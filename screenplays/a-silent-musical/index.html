RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON</h3><p>There is a piano centre stage. The audience sit at tables enjoying their meals and chatting.</p><p>A young man in a suit takes centre stage and speaks into a microphone.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>ANNOUNCER</h4><p>And now, ladies and gentlemen, Cassandra...</p></div> <p>The man walks off and takes a seat at the side of the stage.</p><p>CASSANDRA walks across the stage and takes a seat at the piano.</p><p>A young woman of 36, she is dressed casually, in lunch-wear, but pulls off her look elegantly.</p><p>A minority of the audience look up from their tables to see her at the piano. They are eating light meals. Many have salads whilst others enjoy sandwiches and baguettes.</p><p>She elegantly strokes the air above the keys before putting her fingers to them.</p><p>Hesitantly, she plays the first note and begins her song.</p><p>The audience's attention remains predominantly on their meals.</p><p>But Cassandra is playing confidently.</p><p>Her fingers press each key, playing the song.</p><p>The hammers hit the strings inside and they vibrate.</p><h3>INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>DAVID draws a ruled line onto paper.</p><p>He is dressed professionally in a suit jacket but with a casual T-shirt beneath. He is well looked after, his age of 42 hardly showing.</p><p>He looks at the rough outline of a design.</p><p>Continuing, he begins to draw an image within a box starting with a sketched outline.</p><h3>INT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>BEN is doodling alongside his simple math notes.</p><p>He is a young child, of only nine years old. He and the other children in the class are dressed in school uniforms.</p><p>He looks up to the board to see what more has been written and copies it down into his notes.</p><p>His pencil moves back to the doodle he was drawing.</p><p>But he instead looks up to the clock.</p><p>It is ten past three.</p><h3>INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>CASSANDRA begins to sing along with her music.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>Here's to the irony,<br>And the love that it provides,<br>For I'm a singer, like a songbird with a mate,<br>But the music doesn't make it inside,<br>He can listen, and he does so all the time,<br>But he's never heard a single word,<br>And can't comprehend the rhyme.</p></div> <h3>INT. OFFICE - MEANWHILE</h3><p>DAVID is approached by an interpreter for the deaf; the man is wearing a full suit and tie, very formal.</p><p>The man taps David on the shoulder and signals for him to follow.</p><h3>INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>CASSANDRA continues to play the piano elegantly.</p><p>The hammers still hit at the strings which still vibrate.</p><p>The audience remain only lightly interested.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>It's been difficult to raise a chick,<br>‘cause they're not songbirds like myself,<br>He shares his father's armor chink,<br>So though I sing my songs for him,<br>I know they can't be heard,</p></div> <h3>INT. SCHOOL - MEANWHILE</h3><p>The teacher, female, approaches BEN and taps him on the shoulder.</p><p>Ben looks up.</p><p>The teacher uses sign language to ask if Ben is managing.</p><p>Ben nods and smiles.</p><h3>INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>CASSANDRA's playing of the piano grows more dramatic.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>Here's to the irony,<br>And to loving them both dearly,<br>Even if they cannot hear me,<br>I've received more than it's possible to give,<br>My music is the ink to the page,<br>But they are each the pen,<br>Muses to music they'll never hear,<br>A thousand songs I'd sing for them,<br>And then a million more,<br>My brave and beautiful angels,<br>With but a single flaw,<br>They'll never know in full what they've been inspiration for,</p></div> <p>Some of the audience are in discussion with one another.</p><p>Others are watching Cassandra while some remain focused on their meals.</p><p>Cassandra's music has grown soft again.</p><p>Her voice begins to shy away also.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>Here's to the irony.</p></div> <h3>INT. OFFICE - MEANWHILE</h3><p>DAVID is being led into the boss' private office space.</p><h3>INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS</h3><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>Here's to the irony.</p></div> <h3>INT. SCHOOL - MEANWHILE</h3><p>BEN is watching the clock eagerly, along with most of his classmates.</p><p>His pencil taps at the page in his notebook.</p><h3>INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS</h3><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>Here's to the irony.</p></div> <p>Cassandra plays her final notes and removes her hands from the keys, placing them in her lap.</p><p>There is a small ripple of applause from the audience.</p><p>She smiles sweetly at them before standing and walking across the stage to leave.</p><h3>INT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>The school bell rings violently.</p><p>Pupils around BEN all get up and pack immediately.</p><p>He is right behind them in this.</p><p>They file out of the door but Ben waits for a moment with the teacher.</p><p>He hands her a drawing and smiles before walking out.</p><h3>INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>In with the boss, a man of 49 with his age clearly having caught up with him, and an interpreter for the deaf, DAVID takes a seat.</p><p>The boss begins to speak, as the interpreter signs his words.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>BOSS</h4><p>You've been a fantastic employee with us hear for a long time now, David, which is why I regret to inform you of our decision to let you go. Cut backs have got to be made and unfortunately you'll be one of the lay offs during this period.</p></div> <p>David stares at his boss in disbelief.</p><p>He begins to sign towards the interpreter.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>This is ridiculous. I have been a hard worker. I've been nothing but it. There are layabouts out there doing a third of the work I do.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>BOSS</h4><p>I'm sorry, David. I've got to...</p></div> <p>David shakes his head and ignores the bosses following words.</p><p>He stands up gesturing his annoyance and walks out of the room.</p><p>From his desk, he picks up his various pieces of work and packs them into a briefcase.</p><p>He looks around the desk a final time and then walks towards the exit.</p><h3>EXT. SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>BEN is in the playground watching as some of the other children play.</p><p>An older child pushes Ben from behind.</p><p>He turns around to see there are five of these larger children; all in the year above between ages of 10 and 11.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>BULLY 1</h4><p>Can't you hear me, deaf boy?</p></div> <p>Ben shakes his head.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>BULLY 1 (CONT'D)</h4><p>The cheeky bugger's just answered my question, lads. How is it our little deaf boy here can hear me?</p></div> <p>Ben tries to turn away but the bully grabs him and pulls him back around.</p><p>A teacher spots the acts going on and runs over.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>TEACHER</h4><p>Leave the lad alone, now. If I catch you hastling him again, I'll have to be calling all of your parents.</p></div> <p>She leads Ben away towards the edge of the playground where a car is pulling up.</p><p>CASSANDRA steps out.</p><p>Ben walks past her and takes a seat in the car.</p><p>Cassandra speaks with the teacher.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>TEACHER (CONT'D)</h4><p>Your lad's having a small problem with bullies at the moment, Mrs. Turner. We're gonna do all we can for him; he's a great little boy. I've just had to guide him away from a rowdy bunch over there now.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p>Oh, thank you.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>TEACHER</h4><p>Don't mention it, Cassandra. Probably best you have his father have a chat with him, though. I'm sure he must have been through the same sort of trouble in his school days.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p>Yes. Thank you. Of course. We're both trying our best for him. Ben and myself will be seeing you again tomorrow.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>TEACHER</h4><p>Bye now.</p></div> <p>Cassandra gets into the car.</p><p>She puts on her seat belt, checks her blind spots and then drives away.</p><h3>EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON</h3><p>The car pulls into the driveway and parks in front of a garage.</p><p>The house it connects to is quite large, depicting the owners as being fairly well off.</p><p>CASSANDRA and BEN exit the car.</p><p>Cassandra follows Ben to the front door of the house.</p><h3>INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>DAVID is sat on the sofa with a glass of red wine in his hand.</p><p>His attention is lazily focused on the bottle of wine on the coffee table.</p><p>CASSANDRA and BEN arrive at the door.</p><p>She signs to Ben.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>Go play.</p></div> <p>Ben is hesitant, looking to his father.</p><p>He moves out of the room when his mother gently pushes him out, though he still looks with concern at his father.</p><p>Cassandra sits down next to David.</p><p>They speak in sign language.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>What's happened?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>The firm has sacked me.</p></div> <p>He takes a sip from his wine then puts the glass on the table.</p><p>Cassandra takes his hand and kisses it.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>There will be other jobs.</p></div> <p>David is unresponsive.</p><p>He tops up his glass with more wine.</p><p>Cassandra pulls his face around to look at her.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>We will be okay.</p></div> <p>David nods miserably.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>How was your show?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>It wasn't great. Lunch time audiences in a restaurant aren't interested in paying any attention.</p></div> <p>David takes his glass from the table and has a drink.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>We will get through this.</p></div> <p>She kisses him on the cheek.</p><p>Lifting the bottle of wine with her, she stands up and exits the room.</p><p>Ben re-enters and slowly walks back to his father.</p><p>He sits down and hugs him.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>What are we going to do, son. Your dad's lost his job.</p></div> <p>Ben sits quietly and thinks.</p><p>He gets up and runs out of the room.</p><h3>INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>BEN rummages through his school bag, taking out leaves of paper.</p><p>He finds the one he is looking for and runs back into the living room.</p><h3>INT. LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>BEN approaches DAVID on the sofa.</p><p>He hands his father a leaf of paper.</p><p>There is a drawing on it of David hard at work drawing.</p><p>David hugs Ben.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>Thank you. This is beautiful.</p></div> <p>Ben smiles.</p><p>David stands up and puts the picture in his pocket.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>Let's go draw together, shall we?</p></div> <p>Ben nods enthusiastically.</p><p>David follows him out of the lounge.</p><h3>INT. MUSIC ROOM - EVENING</h3><p>CASSANDRA plays the piano in the centre of the room.</p><p>DAVID enters and walks across to her.</p><p>He watches her, smiling as she plays.</p><p>She smiles back and plays more for him.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>You were stood across the room from me,<br>You couldn't hear me sing at all,<br>But to this day you look, I see,<br>You've enjoyed my every note,<br>So I love it when you come to call.<br>Every time I see your face,<br>I see you're seeing my face too,<br>And since you can't get so distracted,<br>By the sounds that just pass through,<br>I know you're truly in their looking,<br>You've got a pair of loving eyes,<br>I've got a pair of those myself,<br>And I use them just on you,<br>We can bring them both together now,<br>My face to yours, will rise,<br>And your silent mouth will kiss mine,<br>And I'll be without sound with you,<br>While there's silent explosions inside.</p></div> <p>Cassandra stops singing and plays out the final part of the song on the piano.</p><p>David watches passionately.</p><p>When Cassandra plays her final note, he sits down next to her.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>What are we going to do?</p></div> <p>David pulls a leaf of paper from his pocket.</p><p>He flattens it out onto the music sheet holder of the piano.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>Ben's work. He's a little genius.</p></div> <p>Ben's drawing displays David sketching and Cassandra playing the piano.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>We'll put on a proper show for you.</p></div> <p>He points at himself in the drawing then continues signing.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>I'll handle the venue booking and the advertising.</p></div> <p>He points at Cassandra in the drawing.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID (CONT'D)</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>And you will play your music for a real audience.</p></div> <p>Cassandra smiles and lifts up the picture.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>Ben drew me?</p></div> <p>David nods.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>He adores you.</p></div> <p>Cassandra puts the paper back.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>Are you sure I'm ready for my own show?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>DAVID</h4><p class="parenthetical">(sign language)</p><p>I've always been sure of you.

SCHOOL - DAY</h3><p>BEN and SARAH are playing in the playground.</p><p>Sarah is slightly older than Ben, she is from the year above and is 10 years old, and has learnt sign language to communicate with him.</p><p>They play hide and seek. Ben counts as Sarah runs and hides.</p><p>With his eyes closed, Ben is approached by a group of larger boys.</p><p>One of them pushes Ben's shoulder, hard.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>BULLY 1</h4><p>Was that your girlfriend, deaf boy?</p></div> <p>Ben looks around and sees Sarah has hidden well, out of sight.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>BULLY 1 (CONT'D)</h4><p>Why'd she run away, then?</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>BULLY 2</h4><p>Girls don't like deaf boys.</p></div> <div class="dialogue"><h4>BULLY 1</h4><p>That's right.

We look forward to hearing from you.”</p><p>His hand moves to the mouse which he manoeuvres across the mouse pad.</p><p>The cursor on screen moves to an MP3 file.</p><p>His finger double-clicks the left mouse button.</p><p>CASSANDRA walks into the room and over to David.</p><p>She places a mug of hot coffee on the table and kisses him on the cheek.</p><p>He smiles at her and she smiles back.</p><p>Cassandra then leaves the room.</p><h3>INT. MUSIC ROOM - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>CASSANDRA walks to the piano and takes a seat.</p><p>She flips over the pages of music in front of her.</p><p>Settling on a song, she begins to play.</p><div class="dialogue"><h4>CASSANDRA</h4><p class="parenthetical">(song)</p><p>Far away, far, far away from here,<br>There is a place where people go, I know,<br>To get away from the life they've chose,<br>And to live without a care or fear,<br>But it's far away,<br>And I think I'm better off here,<br>‘cause I'm not alone,<br>I've got my rock and little stone,<br>And I know that they'll get me by,<br>When there's trouble deep, deep inside,<br>My rock will be right there for me,<br>With my stone standing by him too,<br>And they will provide,<br>A comfort to quell the noise inside,<br>So I'm not sailing on an open sea,<br>And I've never cared for flight,<br>Though there's mountains stood surrounding me,<br>I'll put them out of sight,<br>‘cause I'm happy right where I'm at,<br>Oh there's a place where people go, I know,<br>To get away from the life they've chose,<br>And to live without a care of fear,<br>But I'm not alone,<br>I've got my rock and my stone,<br>So I know I'm better off here.</p></div> <p>Cassandra plays out the final melody and stops.</p><p>She turns the pages of music in front of her.</p><h3>EXT.

## First Time Viewing Order

If it's your first time watching Star Wars, I absolutely recommend release order. That's 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9.

If you're introducing a child to Star Wars, this is probably sacrilege but chronological might work best, leading with the most kid-targeted films up front: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

This list isn't really for a first time viewer though. It's my considered preference, having already seen the saga at least a couple of times.

### Other Orders

Release Order: 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9

Chronological Order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

...and then the sequels? ...or The Mandalorian? ...or the Clone Wars saga?

Probably the sequels, treating the shows as additional material that can be viewed later. Like... they're too long, really, too disruptive to the pattern. Mandalorian, not so much, but it has characters/McGuffins that benefit from having watched the Clone Wars saga first, so...

1. The Clone Wars (Movie)
2. The Clone Wars (TV Series)
3. Rebels (TV Series)
4. The Mandalorian (TV Series)

...and maybe eventually The Bad Batch squeezes in after Rebels. Not sure. Maybe TCW, Rebels, TBB are the making of an animated saga. And the Mandalorian is... something else after that.

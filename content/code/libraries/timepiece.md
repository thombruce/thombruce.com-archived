Timepiece is an old project I originally wrote for Ruby on Rails. There, it exposed a Ruby helper that allowed the user to easily drop in a digital or analog clock, a timer, or a countdown into any HTML page with ease. I've been thinking about rewriting the plugin in JavaScript for a long time and have begun the process now as a Nuxt module.

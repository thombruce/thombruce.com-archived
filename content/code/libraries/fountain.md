INT. CAFÃ‰ - DAY

KIRSTEN and KATHERINE, two gorgeous identical twins, are sat either side of a small table with shopping bags around their feet indicative of a large clothing purchase.

Katherine is holding a dress up to herself and posing.

KATHERINE
Freddie is going to love me in this! Did I tell you he's taking me to a big party at the end of the month? His sort of crowd, you know; models, actors, musicians. It's going to be amazing and I am going to look so hot in this, don't you think?

Kirsten nods weakly.

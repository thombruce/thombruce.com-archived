View From Here hired me to work on their 360Â° Feedback platform. It had previously been built using Perl and benefitted from Perl's superior string parsing and natural language processing capabilities. I suggested migrating to Rails as I'd done a lot of similar work in the more modern framework on my own hobby project, Quotable.

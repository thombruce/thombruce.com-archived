- [x] Domain

I purchased my domain, thombruce.com, from [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/).

- [x] DNS

The DNS at Namecheap wasn't stellar, so I hooked up my domain's DNS with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

- [x] Basic Website

Nuxt.js

- [x] Source control

GitHub/GitLab

- [x] Web hosting

ThomBruce.com is being hosted by Netlify.

- [x] Uptime Monitoring and Status Page

Formerly, I've monitored my websites using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). My new status page at [status.thombruce.com](https://status.thombruce.com/) uses [Upptime](https://upptime.js.org/).

- [x] Content

Nuxt Content

- [ ] Content Management System

At present I'm just using a code editor, Visual Studio Code, but I have plans to develop a separate CMS.

- [ ] Site Interactivity (Comments, etc.)

I'd like to add some basic interactivity to ThomBruce.com. For this, I'm thinking of installing [Staticman](https://staticman.net/). Staticman would allow users to add comments; they'd take a minute to appear as live on the website because Staticman would send them to the static site generator, so this wouldn't do for a live chat or anything like that, but for comments, maybe a guestbook? It could work.

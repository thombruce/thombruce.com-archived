I've added createdAt and updatedAt, each a date field that we'll use to show when a piece of content was added and whether it has received an update; we can also use these to sort our articles by time. Then there are the categories, series and tags attributes. These three are collections of attributes; in practice, series in particular may only list one, but I like to leave it open to having multiple values. We call these taxonomies, and they list values that will enable us to show the association between two pieces of content. For example, if two separate pieces of content are in the 'Programming' category, they can be listed together on a category page, or they can be recommended as further reading in the footer of either article. Tags are a more broad set of keywords, and series might be used to associate articles in, well, a series - "},{type:b,tag:C,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"this one follows this one"}]},{type:a,value:"."}]},{type:a,value:f},{type:b,tag:j,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"We don't have to stop there, and I will certainly revisit this in future as I consider whether review article types require a score parameter and other such considerations, but we will leave it there for now. One big missed consideration just now is an image. Even if my blog doesn't display images, it remains useful to have an image associated with an article so that it will be displayed when we share it on social media; that type of image is called an OpenGraph image, because it is written into the OpenGraph data which Facebook and other services use to understand the content being shared. I'll revisit that in a future article too, I think. But just for now, having the ability to at least sort my articles by creation time is enough."}]}]},dir:"\u002Fblog",path:"\u002Fblog\u002Fanatomy-of-a-blog-post",extension:".md",updatedAt:"2021-06-10T03:25:37.299Z"},_img:{}}],fetch:{"0":{}},mutations:[["staticman\u002Fpush",{path:"\u002F_data\u002Fcomments\u002Fblog\u002Fanatomy-of-a-blog-post",comments:[]}]]}}("text","element","span","token","punctuation","\n","key","atrule",":","p","---","code"," ","[","]","anatomy-of-a-blog-post","Nuxt.js","div","nuxt-content-highlight","pre","language-md","line-numbers","front-matter-block","font-matter","yaml","language-yaml","title","description","em")));

This limits the benefits of version control, significantly; if a file changes, then the whole file changes rather than just a line or two. They're also large files, so this accumulates; the more large files we have, the more changes that are made to them, then the more junk data we're committing to version control.

Well... GitHub are the owners and developers of Git LFS, but they have made it open source and it has largely been adopted as a standard by other Git storage providers. What matters to me, since I'm creating a blog that should just grow and grow with more and more images and other files being added, is storage capacity. By default GitHub allow 1GB of Git LFS storage, though I believe this can be increased with other paid plans. Over on GitLab, however, the storage limit is 10GB per repo. This is... ten times more, obviously."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Realistically, do I think I will hit this limit? ... Maybe eventually. The one image I do have stored currently is only around 222 kilobytes, one fifth of a megabyte, or one five-thousandth of a gigabyte, so I could store almost 50 thousand images with GitLab's LFS limit. So... do I think I will hit that limit? No time soon.

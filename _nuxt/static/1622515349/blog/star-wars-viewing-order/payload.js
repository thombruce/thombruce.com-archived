Like I said, it's difficult to find where they fit in the saga; their vision is not as clear as in the original trilogy or even the prequels. In general, they are better films than the prequels... but the question of whether or not they belong in the saga is a tough one. My answer to that is this: They are Leia's trilogy. Prior to their release, the prophecy of one who would restore balance to the Force was assumed fulfilled by the end of Return of the Jedi. These films seem to undo that, and I argue the case that a certain character has cheated the prophecy - they knew about it, planned for it, and cheated their fate. But when you mess with fate, fate tends to mess back. Where once Luke confronted Vader and brought balance to the Force, the secondary disruption is rebalanced through Leia's relationships with important characters - she trains a Jedi apprentice, she reaches out to a conflicted Sith, she inspires hope and optimism in the forces of the Resistance."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"If the original trilogy is Luke's trilogy, I argue, and the prequel trilogy is Vader's, then the sequel trilogy is a prophecy cheated and is Leia's trilogy - through her, and through two lineages each arguably matching the prophecy, a dyad in the Force is created that undoes the cheating of fate and restores balance to the Force once again."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"It's a... strained and inconsistently told chapter in the saga, but I believe this interpretation works.

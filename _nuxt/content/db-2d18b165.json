tools I might like to employ is charts. I've worked with charts before using a number of different libraries. My favourite, simply because it appears to be the most powerful and flexible, is [D3.js](https://d3js.org/). Unfortunately, because it is so powerful and flexible, it is not easy to drop in and use straight away - I would need to do a lot of custom configuration. So, as a simpler measure for the time being, I've opted to install the beautiful little [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library.\n\n**Installation:**\n\n```sh\nyarn add vue-chartjs chart.js@2.9.4\n```\n\n**Component:**\n\n```vue[BarChart.vue]\n<script>\nimport { Bar } from 'vue-chartjs'\n\nexport default {\n  extends: Bar,\n  props: [\n    'labels',\n    'datasets'\n  ],\n  mounted () {\n    this.renderChart({\n      labels: this.labels,\n      datasets: this.datasets\n    })\n  }\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n\n```md\n<bar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></bar-chart>\n```\n\nThat's a simple, drop-in and start using solution to a problem I don't need to give a lot of consideration just yet.\n\nThe library is lacking in some advanced features, but many of these can be added through plugins - I'm just not really sure how to go about that using the Vue package yet. I also think I could clean up the manner in which I pass data to the component - it could be simplified, more intuitive. Chart.js may need the data in this format, but I can simplify the props required for end users; one big thing I may add is a series of default colours that are selected automatically. But for now, this will do.\n\nUsing this library, I now have access to the following charts, and could expand a little on this list in the future:\n\n<div class='flex flex-wrap'>\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Bar Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-bar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-bar-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Horizontal Bar Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-horizontal-bar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-horizontal-bar-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Line Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-line-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`, fill: true, data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-line-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Pie Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-pie-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderWidth: 0, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-pie-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Doughnut Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-doughnut-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderWidth: 0, backgroundColor: [`#EF4444`, `#3B82F6`, `#10B981`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-doughnut-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Polar Area Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-polar-area-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: [`rgba(239, 67, 68, 1)`, `rgba(39, 185, 129, 1)`, `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`], backgroundColor: [`rgba(239, 67, 68, .25)`, `rgba(39, 185, 129, .25)`, `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`], data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-polar-area-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Radar Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-radar-chart :labels='[`One`, `Two`, `Three`]' :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`, data: [40, 20, 12] }]'></playfair-radar-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Scatter Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-scatter-chart :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, backgroundColor: `#EF4444`, data: [{ x: 20, y: 30 }, { x: 40, y: 10 }] }, { label: `Data2`, backgroundColor: `#3B82F6`, data: [{ x: 35, y: 15 }] }]'></playfair-scatter-chart>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class='w-full md:w-1/2 md:p-5'>\n  <h2>Bubble Chart</h2>\n\n  <playfair-bubble-chart :datasets='[{ label: `Data`, borderColor: `rgba(239, 67, 68, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(239, 67, 68, .25)`, data: [{ x: 20, y: 30, r: 20 }, { x: 40, y: 10, r: 10 }] }, { label: `Data2`, borderColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 1)`, backgroundColor: `rgba(59, 130, 246, .25)`, data: [{ x: 35, y: 15, r: 50 }] }]'></playfair-bubble-chart>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n_Update (2021-05-28): I've now packaged these charts into my own custom library, [Vue Playfair](https://github.com/thombruce/vue-playfair)._","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/charting-it-out","extension":".md","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530190808},"$loki":4},{"slug":"doing-things-with-markdown","description":"Exploring and extending Markdown's capabilities","title":"Doing Things with Markdown","createdAt":"2021-05-20T14:05:39.000Z","categories":["Journal"],"series":["Getting Started"],"tags":["Blogging","Nuxt.js","Markdown"],"toc":[{"id":"typography","depth":2,"text":"Typography"},{"id":"inline-code--code-blocks","depth":2,"text":"Inline Code & Code Blocks"},{"id":"images","depth":2,"text":"Images"},{"id":"tables","depth":2,"text":"Tables"},{"id":"nuxt-components","depth":2,"text":"Nuxt Components"},{"id":"markdown-extensions","depth":2,"text":"Markdown Extensions"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I want to go over again what's possible with Markdown;

Just to recover it here, this short paragraph has made use of a title, a link, italic and bold text. It was written like this:\n\n```md\n## Typography\n\nI've mentioned [elsewhere](/blog/no-going-back) what _is_ and _isn't_ possible in **Markdown** natively in terms of typography, and what can be achieved using HTML instead. Just to recover it here, this short paragraph has made use of a title, a link, italic and bold text. It was written like this:\n```\n\n## Inline Code & Code Blocks\n\nLet's cover code blocks quickly since I've just shown one off. There are a few ways to write these in Markdown, but most commonly used are the three back-ticks, like so: `` ``` ``. These are placed above and below the block of code we want to enclose. The top set also accepts a language argument: `` ```js ``. Nuxt's parser extends the standard with support for a file-name attribute too: `` ```js[myFile.js] ``. Putting all of that together, we get a code block:\n\n```js[myFile.js]\nimport otherFile from './otherFile.js'\n\nexport default {\n  hello: 'world',\n}\n```\n\n## Images\n\nI've already partially discussed ways to include images in Markdown [here](/blog/images-and-nuxt). I'm still, for the time being, using the Nuxt Image component for the benefits that offers.\n\n## Tables\n\nHere's a table I've just copied over from [another page](code/thom-bruce-com):\n\n| Domain | DNS | Framework | Source | Hosting | CI/CD | Status | Content API | CMS | CDN | Comments |\n| --- | ---|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) | [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) | [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Upptime](https://status.thombruce.com/) | Static | File System | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)\n\nThe Markdown for that looks like this:\n\n```md\n| Domain | DNS | Framework | Source | Hosting | CI/CD | Status | Content API | CMS | CDN | Comments |\n| --- | ---|  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com/) | [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) | [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Upptime](https://status.thombruce.com/) | Static | File System | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) | [Staticman](https://staticman.net/)\n```\n\nI haven't done much to style it besides ensuring that it remains readable with overflow scrolling.\n\n## Nuxt Components\n\nNot native to Markdown, Nuxt has support for dropping in components, like this Media Card I made:\n\n<media-card item='/media/movies/spider-man-no-way-home'></media-card>\n\n```md\n<media-card item='/media/movies/spider-man-no-way-home'></media-card>\n```\n\nThere's nothing more to it than that. I just create and modify the Media Card component as part of my code, and if I change it then the changes will be automatically applied here too. I can drop in other components too, like a map:\n\n<map-view place='carlisle'></map-view>\n\n```md\n<map-view place='carlisle'></map-view>\n```\n\nThey could get a little verbose if I wanted to do something particularly complicated, but with drop-in components like these it's possible to add absolutely anything I want to a Markdown document.\n\n## Markdown Extensions\n\nThere's at least one other Markdown extension active by default. That is checklists like this one:\n\n- [x] One\n- [x] Two\n- [ ] Three\n\n```md\n- [x] One\n- [x] Two\n- [ ] Three\n```\n\nThat can come in pretty useful.\n\nAs well as this, I need to make note that Nuxt uses Remark under the hood which, along with Rehype, supports adding additional plugins. It's documented in Nuxt Content [here](https://content.nuxtjs.org/configuration#markdown).\n\nOne plugin I am eager to install (so will do right now) is the [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math) plugin. To install, it seems I need to `yarn add remark-math rehype-katex` and then modify nuxt.config.js like so:\n\n```js[nuxt.config.js]\n  content: {\n    markdown: {\n      remarkPlugins: [\n        'remark-math'\n      ],\n      rehypePlugins: [\n        'rehype-katex'\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n```\n\nAfter which, I should be able to add inline math ($N$) as well as math blocks like this one:\n\n$$\nN = R_* \\cdot f_\\mathrm{p} \\cdot n_\\mathrm{e} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{l} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{i} \\cdot f_\\mathrm{c} \\cdot L\n$$\n\nHow much use I'll get out of that, I don't know. I've considered getting back into mathematics a little bit, so we'll see.","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/doing-things-with-markdown","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530190901},"$loki":5},{"slug":"github-v-gitlab-lfs","description":"My choice of a Git remote.","title":"GitHub Vs.

I've been writing content to roughly describe some thought processes as I develop the site itself, and now the next step is to take it online.\n\nBefore talking about hosting and serving the site to the public though (which I know I'll be using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to do), I need to decide on a place to store my source code... Actually, that's a lie. It isn't strictly necessary, but it is very good practice and I may write a post in the future about the benefits of Git or version control more broadly. Anyway, for my purposes right now I just want to decide on a place to store my source code, and my choices are GitHub or GitLab.\n\nBefore this morning, I actually thought I'd go with GitHub because I prefer the interface and it doesn't have the limitations that it used to which made me adopt GitLab in preference a long time ago. But... a static blog website isn't your typical coding project. My last article was about images, and they require some special consideration.\n\nImages, you see, they tend to be binary file formats rather than text. This limits the benefits of version control, significantly; if a file changes, then the whole file changes rather than just a line or two. They're also large files, so this accumulates; the more large files we have, the more changes that are made to them, then the more junk data we're committing to version control. The most popular solution to this is [Git LFS (or Git Large File Storage)](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Git LFS, when installed and told which files to exclude, will not commit those files to version control, but will instead commit pointers to the files elsewhere - the files are stored and revised more typically then, in a manner better fitting large, binary files.\n\nWhat does this have to do with my choice between GitHub and GitLab? Well... GitHub are the owners and developers of Git LFS, but they have made it open source and it has largely been adopted as a standard by other Git storage providers. What matters to me, since I'm creating a blog that should just grow and grow with more and more images and other files being added, is storage capacity. By default GitHub allow 1GB of Git LFS storage, though I believe this can be increased with other paid plans. Over on GitLab, however, the storage limit is 10GB per repo. This is... ten times more, obviously.\n\nRealistically, do I think I will hit this limit? ... Maybe eventually. The one image I do have stored currently is only around 222 kilobytes, one fifth of a megabyte, or one five-thousandth of a gigabyte, so I could store almost 50 thousand images with GitLab's LFS limit. So... do I think I will hit that limit? No time soon. But if I do upload more and different kinds of files, eventually, then perhaps we bump into that eventually and need to consider another solution.\n\nThe limiting factor, then, is bandwidth. Apparently, GitLab still have no strict limit on bandwidth usage but they do have some general discussion about [acceptable use](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/1003#note_19874603); obviously trying to use a free service to serve up the next Netflix would be unfair, and naturally draw quick attention from GitLab to be shut down.\n\nFortunately, I can prevent high bandwidth usage by caching... and I think this is something which Netlify (mentioned up top) support by default... _I tried to link to information here but all sources found were vague and inconclusive; the answer is roughly \"yes\" though._\n\nSo that... I think that settles it.

Nuxt Image adds image processing to Nuxt, so that I don't have to fret too much about manually handling those things.\n\nI have to do a couple of things to add it to my project.

And with that, I can control the sizes displayed across different devices. Take note of the `sizes` attributes used below. Here, I've set it to the same value for sm, md and lg (small, medium and large screens), but these can be set individually so that different screens load different sizes. `50vw` and `25vw` below mean \"50% of the view width\" and \"25% of the view width\" respectively, so Nuxt actually will create differently sized images for differently sized screens, even though the values are the same. `vw` could have been `px` instead, which would have meant these were explicit pixel values, rather than sizes relative to screen size.\n\nWhat all of this means is that I can now use the `nuxt-img` tag to generate images at different sizes; not merely the same image displayed at different sizes, but separate images specifically generated for the size that they will appear.\n\n_Note: It is sort of poor practice to load the same image twice; if I want it twice, why not just load it once at the larger of the two values and artificially shrink the second version? The two examples below are included only for demonstration purposes._\n\n### An image at 50vw\n\n```md\n<nuxt-img src='/uploads/blog/rirri-p_swqcXUc1k-unsplash.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw'></nuxt-img>\n```\n\nHow it looks:\n\n<nuxt-img src='/uploads/blog/rirri-p_swqcXUc1k-unsplash.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw'></nuxt-img>\n\n### The same image at 25vw\n\n```md\n<nuxt-img src='/uploads/blog/rirri-p_swqcXUc1k-unsplash.jpg' sizes='sm:25vw md:25vw lg:25vw'></nuxt-img>\n```\n\nHow it looks:\n\n<nuxt-img src='/uploads/blog/rirri-p_swqcXUc1k-unsplash.jpg' sizes='sm:25vw md:25vw lg:25vw'></nuxt-img>\n\nAs stated in the note above, it's a little redundant to load the same image twice here at two separate sizes. An alternative to loading the second image would be to do the following:\n\n```md\n<nuxt-img src='/uploads/blog/rirri-p_swqcXUc1k-unsplash.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw' style='width:25vw;'></nuxt-img>\n```\n\nInstead of loading a separate, smaller version of the image, this would load the same version as the initial tag. The size as displayed is then controlled by CSS in the `style` attribute instead.\n\nThe result looks much the same:\n\n<nuxt-img src='/uploads/blog/rirri-p_swqcXUc1k-unsplash.jpg' sizes='sm:50vw md:50vw lg:50vw' style='width:25vw;'></nuxt-img>\n\nThe aim of course is always to only load precisely what is needed, and no more.\n\nAs a next step, I would really love to tap into the Markdown parser and override its image handling so that I could use `![](/path-to-image.jpg)` syntax and achieve the same result. I leave this, for now, as an exercise for the future.\n\n_Image attribution: Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rirri01?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Rirri</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/polaroids?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a>_","dir":"/blog","path":"/blog/images-and-nuxt","extension":".md","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530190951},"$loki":7},{"slug":"my-first-nuxt-module","description":"My first Vue plugin that integrates seamlessly as a Nuxt module.","title":"My First Nuxt Module","createdAt":"2021-05-23T01:06:56.000Z","categories":["Journal"],"series":["Getting Started"],"tags":["Vue.js","Nuxt.js"],"toc":[],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In putting my blog together, and porting some old code to this new ecosystem, I began to create a... well not overly but still a bit of a cluttered project.

The obvious thing I still needed to do was to clean this up by creating my own Nuxt modules.\n\nProblem: Creating a Nuxt module isn't super well documented just yet.

Thanks for reading."}]}]},"text":"\nHi, and welcome to the one-thousand-three-hundred-and-thirty-seventh iteration of my blog. Okay, granted, that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I really do have a _starting over_ problem. I keep on beginning new versions of my blog as I decide that I want to move to a new technology or I want to organise things a little differently. The first blog I actually wrote was a very long time ago; it was on MySpace, if you remember that website - a social platform from the _Before Facebook_ times. As I became more and more interested in making websites, I moved to WordPress, then I considered more sophisticated CMS platforms like Joomla. Eventually, I became a full-fledged web developer writing my own platforms in Ruby on Rails. Each step of this progression offered me more and more freedom and control; control to have my website behave a certain way, to do more technically difficult but really quite interesting things. And now... Now I've taken a few steps backwards.\n\nSee, this blog post is being written in a plain text editor. Think... Microsoft Word, but if you couldn't add titles, bold text, italic, or any other formatting. It is a plain text document. That doesn't actually mean I can't do things like add titles and **bold** or _italic text_. I can, as you can probably see there, but they are being written as a form of markup in a Markdown document. As I see it presently, that previous sentence looks like this:\n\n```md\nThat doesn't actually mean I can't do things like add titles and **bold** or _italic text_.\n```\n\nNote the `**` enclosing tags to denote **bold text** and the `_` tags to denote _italic_. I like Markdown a lot; nothing is hiding. When you write for the web, the result is typically going to be HTML. That sentence above might render something like this in the end:\n\n```html\n<span>That doesn't actually mean I can't do things like add titles and <strong>bold</strong> or <em>italic text</em>.</span>\n```\n\nIf you use a CMS like WordPress, or if you're writing a document in Microsoft Word, there is a certain magical step that gets hidden. You write rich text, you see the **bolds** and the _italics_, but how it renders to a website is hidden from you. As a developer, I like to know that I have total control. I can use HTML to add <span style=\"color:red;\">c</span><span style=\"color:orange;\">o</span><span style=\"color:yellow;\">l</span><span style=\"color:green;\">o</span><span style=\"color:blue;\">u</span><span style=\"color:violet;\">r</span>, but HTML can be a little overly verbose as in the example above and... well, here's the HTML required to render those colours just now:\n\n```html\n<span style=\"color:red;\">c</span><span style=\"color:orange;\">o</span><span style=\"color:yellow;\">l</span><span style=\"color:green;\">o</span><span style=\"color:blue;\">u</span><span style=\"color:violet;\">r</span>\n```\n\nI prefer cleaner markup, not having to type out quite so much, but I like having that control. So Markdown is great for that. It is a superset of HTML, meaning I can include HTML (as I did to produce that colour effect), but for the most part I can write clean and simple, but still _dynamic_ text that remains easy to read.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I today prefer things like Static Site Generators over the server-dependent systems like WordPress, Joomla and Ruby on Rails. Strictly, I could write Markdown in any of those systems too, but there are other benefits to Static Site Generators. They don't depend on a server, so the websites they produce are highly dependable. They skip the step where the server _figures out_ how to render the HTML; by the time a user is visiting a website produced by a Static Site Generator, the HTML is ready to deliver, so they're also blazing fast and much less fault-prone. But they can still do fancy, programmatic stuff like... for example, converting Markdown to HTML, they just do it earlier than at runtime.

So what if publishing a new page takes a minute instead of a microsecond, we've saved a lot more time for every visitor to the website, and a lot of energy in terms of rendering HTML on a server.\n\nStatic sites won't replace everything, obviously, but we can still integrate dynamic features into static pages. This is why I've chosen [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) as my generator of choice; it's a very flexible JavaScript framework for developing sophisticated applications... that just so happens to also have static site generation built in.

CAFÃ - DAY</h3><p>KIRSTEN and KATHERINE, two gorgeous identical twins, are sat either side of a small table with shopping bags around their feet indicative of a large clothing purchase.</p><p>Katherine is holding a dress up to herself and posing.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KATHERINE</h4><p>Freddie is going to love me in this! Did I tell you he's taking me to a big party at the end of the month? His sort of crowd, you know; models, actors, musicians. It's going to be amazing and I am going to look so hot in this, don't you think?</p></div> <p>Kirsten nods weakly.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KATHERINE (CONT'D)</h4><p>I can't believe I met him, you know. He's an amazing guy; you should meet him. I bet we could set you up with some wonderful actor type... or musician, if you fancy.</p></div> <p>Katherine's phone rings in her bag.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KATHERINE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Oh! That'll be him!</p></div> <p>She checks her phone and reads the screen.</p><p>Kirsten looks into space elsewhere, having lost interest in the conversation.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KATHERINE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Mmh, sis, I've gotta go. Freddie's taking me ice-skating.</p></div> <p>Katherine stands up and lifts her bags.</p><p>She leans over to kiss her sister on the cheek.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KATHERINE (CONT'D)</h4><p>See you later, Kirst.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>Later Kate.</p></div> <p>Katherine exits.</p><p>Kirsten sits stirring her coffee despondently.</p><p>THOMAS enters the cafÃ©, attired in fine business wear and dark sunglasses.</p><p>He walks to Kirsten's table and sits in front of her.</p><p>From behind his black sunglasses, he stares at her.</p><p>Kirsten looks at him for a moment out of the corners of her eyes, before turning her face to engage in conversation.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN (CONT'D)</h4><p>Can I help...</p></div> <p>Thomas removes his glasses as he talks quickly to cut Kirsten off.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Actually, I can help you. My name's Thomas W. Penkey, you can call me Tom. I represent a group of very powerful people.</p></div> <p>Kirsten stares at Thomas, bewildered.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Kirsten... may I call you that?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>How do you...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>This powerful organization, Kirsten, can make any of your wishes come true. They've designated me a sort of... salesman. I make the pitch to you, you accept the wishes and take to reaping the rewards.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>I'm not interested.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>You don't have to be.</p></div> <p>Thomas takes a small business card out of his pocket; only the number, â06665 387729' is printed on it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Whenever you call this number, you will be granted a wish. Please take the card, miss Walsh.</p></div> <p>Kirsten takes the card and examines it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS (CONT'D)</h4><p>You may call three times, you will receive three wishes. I would advise you to choose carefully and to be patient. You may make a wish and not even be aware that it's been granted. Perhaps you'll even put it down to coincidence though I assure you it's not. You're now playing with the fabric of fate, Kirsten. Maybe you could get one over on your sister for once.</p></div> <p>Kirsten looks at Thomas, the card firmly pressed between her fingers.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>How do you...</p></div> <p>Thomas begins standing.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Miss Walsh, it's been a pleasure serving you but I really must go. Enjoy the rest of your coffee and have a very pleasant day.</p></div> <p>He removes a five pound note from his pocket and places it on the table.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS (CONT'D)</h4><p>That should cover your bill. I noticed Katherine bailed on her half before I came in. Don't you hate it when people do that.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>I...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THOMAS</h4><p>Goodbye Kirsten.</p></div> <p>Thomas exits the cafÃ© very quickly.</p><p>Kirsten is left as bewildered by his departure as by his arrival.</p><p>She looks back down at the card in her hands, reads the number, flips it over to look for any more info, then slides it away into her bag and takes a sip of coffee.</p><h3>INT. KIRSTEN'S HALLWAY - DUSK</h3><p>KIRSTEN enters through her front door and dumps her shopping bags in the hallway.</p><p>She leans back against the door and breathes a sigh of relief as it closes behind her.</p><p>Carrying only her handbag, she walks upstairs.</p><h3>INT. KIRSTEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>KIRSTEN drops her handbag on her bed and walks into her en-suite bathroom.</p><p>The shower can be heard as she switches it on and returns to her bag.</p><p>She removes her phone, picking up the calling card as it falls out.</p><p>Staring down at the card, she walks to her mirror.</p><p>She puts the card and her phone down on the dresser-surface in front of her and looks into the mirror.</p><p>She plays with her hair, looking at it in a manner of different styles.</p><p>She pouts at the mirror then relaxes her shoulders and bows her head in shame.</p><p>Spotting the card, she picks it and her phone back up.</p><p>She dials the number, â06665387729â.</p><p>It rings only once.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>VOICE RECORDING</h4><p>Please state your wish after the tone.</p></div> <p>A tone sounds.</p><p>Kirsten hesitates for a moment, eyeing herself up in the mirror.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>I wish I were more beautiful than Katherine.</p></div> <p>The line disconnects and a dial-tone sounds.</p><p>Kirsten looks at her phone, puzzled, hangs it up and places it on the dresser surface once more with the card.</p><p>She walks through to her bathroom, removing her top as she does so.</p><p>Kirsten uses the swing of her hips to close the door behind her.</p><h3>INT. KIRSTEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT</h3><p>KIRSTEN is rolling around uncomfortably in her sleep as her phone rings on the dresser across the room.</p><p>She wakes miserably and pushes herself slowly into a sitting position.</p><p>She stands and walks to her phone.</p><p>It indicates that her mother is ringing her.</p><p>She answers.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>Hello?</p></div> <p>Her mother's voice is broken; she appears to be weeping.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THE TWINS' MUM</h4><p>Kirsten...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>KIRSTEN</h4><p>Mum? What's wrong?</p></div> <p>There is only weeping on the other side of the line.</p><p>It fades quickly and her father's voice takes over.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THE TWINS' DAD</h4><p>Kirsten, dear...

THE GIFT OF LIFE</h3><p>NESTIS stands  up in the nothing.</p><p>She walks through a field of comets and past the planets that lay in front of her.</p><p>Finally she reaches a small rock, third from the sun; lifeless and undistinguished, albeit a small moon.</p><p>The once joyful expression on her face turns morose.</p><p>She kneels before the planet and takes it cupped into her hands.</p><p>She looks upwards away from the world in her hands.</p><p>Closing her eyes, a whimper grows in her throat.</p><p>When she opens her eyes once more, they are watered.</p><p>The little girl begins to cry.</p><p>NESTIS bows her heads towards the globe in her hands.</p><p>A single tear trickles down her cheek.</p><p>This tear trickles down and drops from her chin.</p><p>More and more tears begin to come and fall to the planet.</p><p>Whence the world has been covered in the water of her tears by two thirds, she takes her hands from beneath it and stands.</p><p>NESTIS uses her sleeves to wipe the tears from her eyes.</p><p>Still crying, she walks away from the world.</p><p>On this small planet now, green life creeps forth across land emerging from the blue seas of the little girl's tears.</p><h3>INT. SACRIFICE IN A SCIENCE LAB</h3><p>Two scientists work hastily in a laboratory, STEVE and NANCY, prepping a large board of control switches, behind which lies a large machine.</p><p>Behind a window, looking in, journalists gather and eagerly watch on as another scientist discusses the nature of what they're about to see.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>NANCY</h4><p>So...</p></div> <p>Nancy sits her self down in a comfy office chair.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>NANCY (CONT'D)</h4><p>Do you think we're gonna get âthe Big answerâ here?

One...</p></div> <p>The pair flip their twin-switches in unison.</p><p>In front of them, the machine comes to life.</p><p>The journalists look onwards, mostly struck by awe though some remain cautiously professional in demeanour.</p><p>Steve hunches his body over the control panel, watching the machine intently.</p><p>Nancy looks onwards from the comfort of her chair.</p><p>The machine comes to a slow rest and the limbs of a child, NESTIS, become visible.</p><p>Steve looks on in horror as Nancy rises to her feet with much the same expression.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>NANCY</h4><p>A child? A girl?</p></div> <p>Steve walks around the control panel and approaches the little girl in the machine.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>STEVE</h4><p>With a lot of blue and red crayons.</p></div> <p>He has a concerned look on his face as he checks the girl's pulse.</p><p>A sombre look takes over his face as he turns to Nancy and stares at her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>NANCY</h4><p>She's...?</p></div> <p>Steve bows his head and slowly turns it back to the little girl.</p><p>Behind Nancy, a flash of light disrupts the scene as a journalist takes the opportunity for a photo.</p>"},"dir":"/_data/screenplays","path":"/_data/screenplays/outsider","extension":".fountain","createdAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191090},"$loki":36},{"slug":"sera","title":"Sera","credit":"written by","author":"Thom Bruce","authors":"Thom Bruce","draft_date":"2009-09-30","date":"2009-09-30T00:00:00.000Z","html":{"title_page":"<h1>Sera</h1><p class=\"credit\">written by</p><p class=\"authors\">Thom Bruce</p><p class=\"draft-date\">2009-09-30</p>","script":"<h3>INT.

The brush is then rinsed off and, placed in a toothbrush holder, appropriately labelled then he washes his hands with intense concentration and two squirts of soap.</p><h3>INT. KITCHEN - DAY</h3><p>PERRY enters staring at his feet as he does so but raising his head once again when he is past the frame of the door.</p><p>He opens the fridge and takes out an unopened bottle of milk and places it in the exact centre of the table then opens a cupboard and removes a glass.

He places a discreet amount of toothpaste onto the bristles and brushes his teeth, first the left side, then the right and finishing with his front teeth.</p><p>Then he rinses the brush, places it back in its holder and begins to wash his hands with two squirts of soap and concentrating intensely.</p><h3>INT. LANDING - DAY</h3><p>PERRY stands in front of a door with his hand resting on the door handle and with his eyes closed.</p><p>He breathes in deeply through his nostrils and pushes the door open to enter.</p><h3>INT. COLLECTION ROOM - DAY</h3><p>PERRY enters and walks past an array of shelves. At the top of each set of shelves is a label with the name of a season.</p><p>There is a calendar on the wall. PERRY checks it and marks off the day, February 28th.</p><p>He walks to the set of shelves and stops directly in front of of them. Across the shelf there are labels for each day of the week; one directly below an object that they seemingly correspond to.</p><p>He runs his finger across the shelf from âMondayâ and stops at âThursdayâ. The object is missing.</p><p>He quickly glances around him, down to the floor and around the other shelves in the room.</p><p>He doesn't see the object and walks out of the room quickly looking around nervously.</p><h3>INT. FRONT HALLWAY - DAY</h3><p>PERRY is sat on a chair at the bottom of the stairs with a blank expression on his face just staring into space.</p><p>HELEN walks down the stairs and almost walks straight past him into the kitchen.

The sound of a ticking clock is heard and PERRY looks up to it.</p><p>The clock reads, sixteen minutes to nine. PERRY concentrates on it as the second hand ticks slowly closer to twelve.</p><p>PERRY stands and walks into the kitchen.</p><h3>INT. KITCHEN - DAY</h3><p>PERRY enters and approaches the sink. He puts two squirts of soap into his left hand and turns the tap on then washes his hands vigorously.</p><p>He exits the kitchen.</p><h3>INT. FRONT HALLWAY - DAY</h3><p>PERRY enters and walks to a coat rack. He lifts his coat off of it and puts it on slowly. A name-tag is seen briefly which reads, âPERRY MEAS GRESDON'.</p><p>He walks to the front door, opens it and exits closing it behind him.</p><p>HELEN returns down the stairs and looks towards the door and then around at where Perry had been. She quickly dashes down the stairs, grabs her jacket and pushes her feet into her shoes then dashes to the front door and exits.</p><h3>EXT. STREET - DAY</h3><p>HELEN runs quickly to catch up to PERRY, then she grabs him by the shoulder. He jumps at this and swings round brushing her hand off, almost violently.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>Woah, calm down, Perry. Where are you going?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PERRY</h4><p>I need to go to the harbour.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>What about your... What is it you lost?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PERRY</h4><p>I've got to go count the ships.</p></div> <p>PERRY turns and walks briskly away. HELEN watches him and then looks back to the house.</p><p>Concerned for her friend, she sets off jogging after him.</p><h3>EXT. HARBOUR - DAY</h3><p>HELEN is sat on a bench, looking on towards PERRY who is standing by the railings with a pad and paper, both of them just waiting for something to happen.</p><p>HELEN checks her watch, thirty-four minutes past nine. She rocks back and forth anxiously in here seat.</p><p>PERRY is stood watching over the harbour. A boat leaves and as it does so, he makes a note of the time in his pad.</p><p>He is silent and in concentration, with some remaining worry that the object has still not been found. He then turns his head to the right, having noticed something, puts his pen to paper and makes another note in his pad.</p><p>HELEN is sat with her head slung back over the seat, staring up to the sky. She suddenly moves up, quickly. rising from her seat and walking up behind PERRY</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>Cup of tea, Perry?</p></div> <p>PERRY keeps his eyes fixed on the boats in the harbour.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PERRY</h4><p>I don't usually.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>But you will, today.</p></div> <p>PERRY turns to HELEN, looking a little puzzled, as she leaves the scene then back to the boats in the harbour.</p><p>He continues to make notes as the boats enter and exit the harbour, writing the time in or out and a small description of each one.</p><p>He anxiously checks his watch and looks around to find Helen. She has not yet returned.</p><p>Nervously, he steps closer to the railing and peers over the edge.</p><p>He lets his cheeks give way to a small smile then steps backwards again and regains his prior composure; that of indifference.</p><h3>EXT. HARBOUR - DAY</h3><p>HELEN returns carrying two disposable cups filled with steaming hot tea; each with a stirring stick protruding from the top.</p><p>She gestures with one of them towards PERRY and he retrieves it from her hand and gives a little nod of thanks.</p><p>He places the cup down onto the ground and takes his labelling machine from his pocket.</p><p>HELEN watches as PERRY types in âTEAâ, then picks up the cup and applies the sticker to it.</p><p>PERRY then turns back to look over the harbour again and HELEN acts in kind.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>So, you do this every day?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PERRY</h4><p>Just Thursdays.</p></div> <p>HELEN turns back toward PERRY. yHELEN When you carry your...?</p><p>PERRY looks to HELEN.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PERRY</h4><p>My what?</p></div> <p>HELEN returns to staring over the harbour.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>Never mind, Perry.</p></div> <p>She rests her head against his shoulder.</p><p>PERRY simply stares over the harbour with the same blank expression as usual.</p><p>After a moment he shrugs her off his shoulder.</p><p>She stares at him, quite offended, but he does not look back.</p><p>She then becomes quite morose, feeling guilty for being offended, and returns to sitting on the bench.</p><p>PERRY makes another note on his pad and takes a sip of his tea.</p><h3>EXT. HARBOUR - DAY</h3><p>OPEN ON EMPTY CUP, NEATLY PLACED ON THE GROUND. THE WORD, âTEA' IS LABELLED ON IT WITH ANOTHER LABEL BELOW IT, âEMPTY'. PAN UP FROM CUP TO PERRY.</p><p>PERRY is stood still looking out over the harbour. HELEN has lay down on the bench.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>Do you ever wonder, Perry, if maybe we're all just following patterns we're not even aware of.</p></div> <p>PERRY turns around, leaving no attention on the harbour for the first time today.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN (CONT'D)</h4><p>I mean a cloud is a cloud. If time didn't move on it would always be a cloud. But eventually, that cloud is going to be rain, then the rain will join a river or go into the drains. Eventually it'll make it out to the sea but then it evaporates and becomes a cloud again.</p></div> <p>HELEN turns her attention from the sky to face PERRY.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN (CONT'D)</h4><p>That's what you are, Perry. A cloud. Just a gentle, misunderstood soul that does what it's supposed to. You exist and follow the currents of the wind. Sometimes you rain, but no one should blame you for that. You're a cloud, just doing what a cloud is supposed to.</p></div> <p>HELEN stands up and grabs PERRY by the arm.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN (CONT'D)</h4><p>Come with me.</p></div> <p>PERRY turns back to the ships in the harbour, reluctant to move anywhere.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PERRY</h4><p>But...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>I promise the ships will still be coming in and out when we get back. Now come on. I'll take good care of you.</p></div> <p>HELEN walks pulling PERRY behind her who is now giving in to her will. They exit the harbour.</p><h3>EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY</h3><p>HELEN walks up the hill briskly, followed by PERRY who is looking a bit nervous.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN</h4><p>Look at this, Perry. Isn't it beautiful?</p></div> <p>PERRY's expression is blank as he reaches the top of the hill.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HELEN (CONT'D)</h4><p>You have a much better view of the boats from here too.</p></div> <p>HELEN turns to PERRY and sees that he is not much impressed.</p><p>She glances to the floor and then back at Perry, before reaching into his jacket pocket.</p><p>She takes out his label maker and types in âPerry and Helen 2008'.</p><p>Then she peels off the label and retrieves the stirring stick, from the cup of tea out of her own pocket and sticks the label to it so that it protrude like a flag.</p><p>She pushes the flag into the ground then sits down beside it and pulls PERRY down beside her.</p><p>Together, PERRY and HELEN look out over the sea from atop the cliff, the small makeshift flag sticking up proudly from the ground between them.</p><h3>INT. FRONT HALLWAY - DUSK</h3><p>The front door opens and PERRY enters, followed by HELEN who closes the door behind her.</p><p>PERRY removes his coat and hangs it up on the coat-hanger.</p><p>He removes the label-maker from his pocket. As he does so, a small toy boat falls from his other pocket.</p><p>PERRY continues to the kitchen, unaware.</p><p>HELEN walks over to it and takes off her own jacket. She spots the toy boat and crouches to pick it up.</p><p>She smiles and runs upstairs quickly, carrying the boat with her.</p><h3>INT. KITCHEN - DUSK</h3><p>PERRY stands at the sink.

Attention lingers on the detailing of the door before ADAM continues out of the room and left through another door.</p><p>With everything drawn in vaguely sketched pencil, our attention is drawn to hang over a sink.</p><p>ADAM's hand extends to one of the taps, itself a basic sketch but dragging a smudge of grey shading across the screen.</p><p>As he turns the cold tap on, the smudges of grey pencil disperse and fade as though to be washed away.</p><p>The water in the sink comes out as though a watercolour painting, several shades of blue.</p><p>ADAM turns his hand over in front of him and witnesses it flooding with reds and pinks.</p><p>His attention flies quickly up the wall, which now appears to have creamy toned watercolours cascading down it.</p><p>In the mirror, we see ADAM's face as a sketch at first.</p><p>His eyes fill in with colour first as we are drawn closer to the image. They turn a glistening, watery blue.</p><p>A moment later, the areas around his eyes flow outwards with the colour red which quickly flows across his face and turns to a more natural pink.</p><p>In the mirror, there is still nothing behind ADAM but a black - unnatural to the rest of this canvas.</p><p>We leave the eyes of ADAM and witness him turning towards the black which leaks into the rest of the watercolour world.</p><p>As he turns into it, it quickly floods with colours the same as the rest of the now entirely watercolour bathroom.</p><p>ADAM twists on the spot and falls quickly down onto the seat of the toilet.</p><p>He brings his hands to his face and rubs them there, hard against his skin.</p><p>His eyes closed, the rubbing of his hands seems to strengthen the colours and detail of the watercolour image.</p><p>There is a knock at the door.</p><p>ADAM's eyes open quickly to look at it, and amongst the rest of the watercolour image his eyes now look to be their photorealistic selves.</p><p>JONNY stands in the doorway, himself now in photographic detail.</p><p>ADAM looks round the room to see, at last, the bathroom as a glistening - as though new - and detailed image seeming perfectly real.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONNY (CONT'D)</h4><p>Are you all right, man...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Has your bathroom always been this clean?</p></div> <p>JONNY looks around the bathroom, puzzled, admiring its cleanliness.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONNY</h4><p>No, man.

See you in five, yeah?</p></div> <p>ADAM opens the door and becomes a black silhouette of himself against a flood of bright, white light from the outside.</p><p>His silhouette raises an arm to shield his eyes as he steps out into the white.</p><p>As the door closes behind him, perhaps merely by contrast and a failure to adjust, the interior of JONNY'S HOUSE fades to a total black - as though to not exist.</p><h3>EXT. TOWN CENTRE - NOON</h3><p>ADAM walks towards a small crowd of people, and a man atop a small pedestal at their centre.</p><p>The seem to glow as though to draw him to them.</p><p>As he wanders toward them, he views the grounds and the buildings in the streets around him.</p><p>There is no rubbish, no chewing gum, the streets seem perfectly bright and clean.</p><p>While clean and pristine, the grounds do distort as he walks; bending as though to stretch away from his feet and then gently exploding into waves as they touch the floor; waves which emanate from the point of contact.</p><p>ADAM stops a short distance from the rear end of the crowd, to listen to the PREACHER's words from the centre which seem louder than the rest of reality around him - crisper, certainly.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PREACHER</h4><p>...ladies and gentlemen, he walks among us. Our Lord, from unfathomable Heavenly plains above us, he is come. We must show ourselves as worthy of his grace, as ready to receive the love of God, for our own saving. Britain is now an isle of the condemned; condemned who place their faith in scientists who say...</p></div> <p>Amongst the crowd, a girl seems to be facing the wrong way; she looks straight towards ADAM.</p><p>ADAM sees her and he looks straight back at EVE, dazed and confused. Her own expression appears neutral but serene.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PREACHER (CONT'D)</h4><p>They say our world must have been created from nothing, because God does not exist! But they also say that nothing cannot beget anything; they say something cannot be created from nothing and that it must have been. It's a puzzle, ladies and gentlemen, but we know the answer; the answer they've tried so hard to remove from the equation...</p></div> <p>At the word equation, ADAM's attention is drawn back to the PREACHER and his focus drawn to the movement of the PREACHER's mouth.</p><p>The word âequation' seems to echo, as though it means something more.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PREACHER (CONT'D)</h4><p>They have removed the universe's most universal constant; God!</p></div> <p>ADAM looks back to where EVE was stood but she is gone, moved to an alleyway.</p><p>He quickly spots her as she disappears from view with a hasty walk.</p><p>Turning his attention back to the PREACHER as he sets off quickly toward the alley, the PREACHER's eyes lock with his as he jogs slightly around the demonstration.</p><p>The PREACHER's eyes follow his.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>PREACHER (CONT'D)</h4><p>You already know the solution!</p></div> <p>ADAM exits down the alleyway.</p><h3>EXT. BACK STREET - NOON</h3><p>ADAM exits the alleyway onto a backstreet and searches the area to try and spot EVE but she is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The only other soul on this street is a homeless man, FIGMENT.</p><p>ADAM turns to FIGMENT and crouches down close to him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT</h4><p>Spare some change, sir?</p></div> <p>ADAM, puzzled, catches himself and shakes some sense back in.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, sure.</p></div> <p>He fumbles with his pocket and takes out some loose coins.</p><p>He hands them to FIGMENT.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT</h4><p>Bless you, young sir.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>You didn't see a girl come down here just now, did you?</p></div> <p>FIGMENT looks square into ADAM's eyes with a smile.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT</h4><p>âfraid not sir. I've just got here myself.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks at the homeless man and is perplexed by the fact that his clothes appear to be brand new, and clean.</p><p>The clothes are worn rather scruffily by figment, but otherwise he appears to be wearing a pristine suit.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Your clothes are...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT</h4><p>Brand new, just like the universe, sir.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>The uni-... no. Why are you wearing a clean suit?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT</h4><p>It's all...</p></div> <p>FIGMENT reaches forward and gives ADAM's cranium two knocks.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT (CONT'D)</h4><p>...up here.</p></div> <p>ADAM rubs his head.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>What do you mean?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT</h4><p>Figment's of your imagination, Adam. My suits brand new because I am.</p></div> <p>ADAM stares at FIGMENT with a confused sort of glare.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>FIGMENT (CONT'D)</h4><p>Thank you for the change, sir.</p></div> <p>ADAM turns away and stands.</p><p>He starts walking away in one direction then spots EVE down the street.</p><p>She is looking back before she turns and walks onto another street.</p><p>ADAM dashes down toward where she had been.</p><h3>EXT. MAIN STREET - NOON</h3><p>ADAM stops fast as he enters main street, almost colliding with a LITTLE OLD LADY.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p class=\"parenthetical\">(mumbled)</p><p>Sorry...</p></div> <p>She navigates around him with a grumble in her voice.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>LITTLE OLD LADY</h4><p>Youth today! All the benefits we never had; what right do you have anyway, to think you're so high and mighty... Wiki-fucking-pedia!</p></div> <p>She turns back to ADAM and yells.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>LITTLE OLD LADY (CONT'D)</h4><p>Think you know everything? You don't know a damn thing about real life!</p></div> <p>With that she turns again and continues on her way.</p><p>ADAM turns his attention to a pair of younger pedestrians as they stroll past.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>YOUNG PEDESTRIAN</h4><p>Do you believe that shit? âGod walks among usâ? Bollocks! And fucking... nothing- something can't come from nothing. What a crock of shite. Maths, purest of all language, states... Simply! One minus one is zero. Reality's a fucking... duality! You know?</p></div> <p>With the words âyou knowâ, having passed ADAM already, the YOUNG PEDESTRIAN's eyes flick back to him for a moment.</p><p>Perhaps only because he was watching them, but he soon is no more.</p><p>ADAM recaptures himself and looks away to the ground with shy, apologetic motion.</p><p>He begins searching the street again for Eve.</p><p>Unable to find her, ADAM turns back into the back street.</p><h3>EXT. BACK STREET - NOON</h3><p>Head hung, ADAM doesn't see JENNY before she sees him.</p><p>Her voice is heard first.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>Adam! There you are.</p></div> <p>As her footsteps grow louder toward him, ADAM looks up to see that she has come from the back alley near where FIGMENT still sits.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Hey.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>Are you all right? You look...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I'm all right.</p></div> <p>ADAM smiles at JENNY as he takes a moment to admire the fact that she, like all of his surroundings, looks equally pretty and new; her blonde hair gleaming from the sunlight shining down on it.</p><p>JENNY smiles back at him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>You could probably use a spliff though. Come on.</p></div> <p>She grabs ADAM by the wrist and leads him down a second alleyway across the street from the first.</p><h3>EXT. SECLUDED BENCH - NOON</h3><p>ADAM is sat back on the bench, resting his arm across the top of it.</p><p>JENNY has her back to an arm rest and has extended her legs across ADAM's lap.</p><p>She sparks up a spliff then fumbles to put her lighter away.</p><p>She takes a toke and then blows out the smoke.</p><p>Each of them watch as the smoke seems to dance through the air.</p><p>JENNY then looks to ADAM.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>So, how's tripping?</p></div> <p>ADAM moves his arms to a drumming position and begins to beat a rhythm onto JENNY's shins.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's been mad... Like, everything's...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>It seems shiny and new, right?</p></div> <p>ADAM turns to her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Exactly. It looks brand new.</p></div> <p>He smiles at her as she takes another toke.</p><p>She then offers the spliff to ADAM and he takes it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>Did you get - like - things people were saying seemed somehow more relevant... Like they meant more than I guess they should've.</p></div> <p>ADAM blows out a cloud of smoke.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah. It was weird.

Before viewing, or choosing to take a measurement... Before we open that proverbial box, the state of its contents is in something called a superposition. This âsuperpositionâ means that it hasn't yet decided what it will be upon observation. In a manner of speaking, it is already all of the options and in another - it is none. What it is, is the potential to be witnessed in one state or another. And when we open the box, it collapses; having no form prior to our witnessing it, its probability to be all other things evaporates and it makes a decision to be the way it is without any history prior to the opening of the box... By choosing to observe, we call a reality into existence.</p></div> <p>The scene slowly collapses into strings toward the end of the TUTOR's speaking.</p><p>Once he is done, the strings disassemble the scene completely.</p><h3>EXT.

THE ROOFTOP - NOON</h3><p>A scene reconstructs; this one appears to hold its solidity.</p><p>ADAM and EVE are facing each other on the rooftop.</p><p>He collapses to his knees, clutching at his head.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Argh, fucking hell!</p></div> <p>EVE kneels down in front of ADAM.</p><p>She takes him by the shoulders, and places her head to his.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Let it be, Adam.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's getting clearer...

To nothing.</p></div> <p>The scene evaporates back into a collection of strings; their violence has subsided but they no longer seem to dance - they seem uninterested in one another, separated.</p><h3>INT.

LECTURE THEATRE - DAY</h3><p>ADAM sits in a seat in the lecture theatre, rubbing the plaster on his head.</p><p>The rest of the room has seats filled with other students.</p><p>The TUTOR stands at the front, in front of a white board.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR</h4><p>You all think that you had a choice in coming here today; you all had the option to bunk off and you still came. It was a decision. But, as those of you who've been paying attention in recent classes will understand, we are more fixed to behave in one way rather than another. Our psychology, it's evolution! We obey the laws of a system- physics, chemistry, biology, neurobiology, sociology. Some great people have made truly tremendous predictions based on patterns in sociological behaviour. So perhaps then, you had no choice; it was determined, and absolutely fixed that you would, each of you, be in this room, sat and barely listening to me - perhaps it was determined long before any of us were even born. Because we behave according to stimulus. Put a puzzle in front of a mathematician and he'll try to solve it; give a class a lecture on a Friday afternoon, and seventy percent will show up.</p></div> <p>ADAM is sat, cheek to his hand and using his arm to prop his head up.</p><p>He is watching the TUTOR, with a feigned interest.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Today we're going to start talking about Schrodinger's Cat; it'll mark the beginning of our study into the philosophy of quantum mechanics, which will present some exotic ideas about the fundamental structure of reality. I want you to give it a lot of thought over the next week, and I want you to remember to think about free will. Exercise a free choice within the next week and we'll talk about them next Friday - we'll try to get an in depth perspective on what's truly free, and what's pre-ordained.</p></div> <p>The TUTOR pauses and looks about the class.</p><p>ADAM is looking, with a bored, lazy expression at his notebook.</p><p>He is scribbling a note.</p><p>âFree will. Make a decision. Defy destiny!â</p><p>The TUTOR turns to the white board and picks up a pen.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Now then... Schrodinger's cat!</p></div> <h3>EXT. GRASSY HILL - NIGHT</h3><p>ADAM is walking over the crest of the hill, away from an area of houses.</p><p>He takes a few steps down the bank and sits.</p><p>He takes a spliff from his pocket, and a lighter, and sparks up.</p><p>Looking up at the stars, he lays back and stares into the black abyss, broken by the diamonds of light.</p><p>He sings a verse from The Beatles' âAcross the Universe'.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Images of broken light, which dance before me like a million eyes...</p></div> <p>He takes a long draw from his spliff and then breathes it out.</p><p>It breaks up in the sky above them, revealing the stars again from behind it's haze.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>They call me on and on, across the universe.</p></div> <p>ADAM lays his head down on his free hand and closes his eyes.</p><h3>EXT. GRASSY HILL - SOMETIME LATER</h3><p>ADAM is sat up on the grassy hill and fumbling with his phone.</p><p>He is mulling over a decision to call EVE.</p><p>He looks up toward the star for a moment, then confidently back down to his phone.</p><p>He hits the call button.</p><p>The phone raised to his ear, he waits a few moments.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Hi... Eve? It's Adam... Yeah, it's good to hear you too.</p></div> <p>He lays back down again the grassy hill.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>Listen, do you want to meet up tomorrow? ... Oh okay... Yeah, Monday's perfect. Lunchtime... I'll see you there. Bye.</p></div> <p>He lowers the phone from his ear and drops it onto the ground beside him.</p><p>Resting his head against his hand and closing his eyes, he speaks to himself slightly singing the words in tune.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>Jai guru deva... om.</p></div> <h3>EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY</h3><p>ADAM's hands attend carefully to the rolling of a joint.</p><p>Sat next to him on the bench is EVE.</p><p>She sits with her body turned toward him and a smile on her face.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>You could've called me sooner.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks to EVE and smiles at her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I was nervous. And then, Saturday night, I was looking at the stars.</p></div> <p>ADAM rolls the paper around the joint and licks the seal.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>My lecturer was talking about fate and free will last week and the stars reminded me of how I came to meet you...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Because you were off your box on acid?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Something like that.</p></div> <p>ADAM takes the joint to his mouth and brings a lighter up to light it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>It seemed like the time. I don't really think I've made a decision.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>It was destiny.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks at EVE and smiles at her broadly.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I guess so... We're trapped in a pattern.. of predictable behaviours.</p></div> <p>ADAM stares off into the distance.</p><p>EVE looks out to where he is looking.</p><p>Off far ahead of them, is a relatively large building surrounded by scaffolding.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>I've loved the idea of climbing that.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Before the end of this week, I see us up there.</p></div> <p>She looks to ADAM and smiles.</p><p>ADAM continues looking out at the building.</p><p>His face turns to contemplation.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Have you heard of Last Thursdayism.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>You mean the Church of Last Thursday?</p></div> <p>ADAM turns to EVE.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah. By the end of this week, the universe may not exist any more.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>You make that sound rather bleak.</p></div> <p>ADAM takes a toke on his spliff.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's just... With the way we met and the stars I was looking at the other night... Just coincidence, I guess, but it kind of speaks to me.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Are you suggesting the whole world exists just for you?</p></div> <p>ADAM offers the joint to EVE and she takes it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I fucking hope not. I guess I'll see when the world doesn't end on Thursday.</p></div> <p>EVE tokes from the joint.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Except that given a day, it'll become just another âLast Thursday'.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Hmm..</p></div> <p>ADAM looks back out at the building.</p><p>EVE gives the spliff back to ADAM.</p><p>He takes a toke from it.</p><p>As he breathes out, he looks down at it in his hand.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>I guess we're easy to predict... And some things... I suppose destiny can't be broken.</p></div> <p>He looks back up and out toward the building.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>We're creatures of habit...</p></div> <h3>INT. EVE'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM is sat on EVE's sofa, with ERWIN the cat on his lap.</p><p>EVE is next to him and turned toward him.</p><p>They each hold a glass of wine in a free hand.</p><p>ADAM looks down to ERWIN as he pets the cat.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's sort of weird, thinking about what we have in common... With animals and each other, I guess.</p></div> <p>EVE sips from her wine.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Mm-hmm.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>We're all kind of connected. Their minds and ours. It all boils down to fundamental, instinctual level psychology. We all live, we all die.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>And in the meantime, we look for something to fuck.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks to EVE.</p><p>EVE grins at ADAM.</p><p>ADAM offers her the same perplexed smile again.</p><p>EVE leans across the sofa to stroke ERWIN.</p><p>She leans closer still to ADAM.</p><p>Their faces, close to touching; her eyes glance to his mouth.</p><p>His eyes glance to hers and both return to lock sights back within one another's gaze.</p><p>EVE closes the distance and begins to kiss ADAM; a passionate snogging ensues.</p><h3>INT. EVE'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM and EVE enter the room kissing.</p><p>She stops only to take ADAM's glass of wine away from him.</p><p>She places both his and her glass on a side-table, then turns back to ADAM.</p><p>He moves toward her and places his arms around her and up her back as they begin to kiss again.</p><p>She removes his T-shirt from over his head, and free from kissing he looks down to her shirt and begins unbuttoning it.</p><p>Before he can finish, EVE twists ADAM around and pushes him onto the bed.</p><p>She mounts him and leans down to begin kissing him once more.</p><h3>EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NOON</h3><p>ADAM and EVE are stood on the rooftop, looking at one another.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I knew you'd be here.</p></div> <p>He steps closer to her and embraces her for a single, quick but passionate kiss.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>Your confidence wouldn't keep you away from here for long.</p></div> <p>ADAM turns out and admires the view.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>And what with it being your last Thursday on Earth, and all?</p></div> <p>ADAM smiles, still looking out over the view.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I thought I'd best make the most of it.</p></div> <p>EVE looks onward to ADAM as he looks out over the scenery.</p><p>The mood is calm, nature seems serene.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>You can see all the world from up here.</p></div> "},"dir":"/_data/screenplays/last-thursday","path":"/_data/screenplays/last-thursday/episode-3","extension":".fountain","createdAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191175},"$loki":86},{"slug":"episode-5","title":"Last Thursday Ep. 5 - House of Mirrors","credit":"written by","author":"Thom Bruce","authors":"Thom Bruce","draft_date":"2010-12-05","date":"2010-12-05T00:00:00.000Z","html":{"title_page":"<h1><span class=\"bold\">Last Thursday</span><br />Ep. 5 - House of Mirrors</h1><p class=\"credit\">written by</p><p class=\"authors\">Thom Bruce</p><p class=\"draft-date\">2010-12-05</p>","script":"<h3>EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NOON</h3><p>Static fills the screen and white noise dominates the audio.</p><p>Quickly though, it fades away to reveal ADAM on the rooftop and looking into camera.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Wait... There was more.</p></div> <p>Detail fades quickly from ADAM as photorealism is taken back over by pencil sketches.</p><h3>INT. JONNY'S HOUSE - NOON (ONE WEEK AGO)</h3><p>A sink is drawn in the scene, and lightly shaded.</p><p>ADAM's pencil-sketch hands reaches to a tap and turns it on.</p><p>Suddenly, with the sound of water, the grey shadings of pencil are smudges and faded as though being washed away.</p><p>Water comes from the tap and spirals in the basin, it has colour; a watercolour blue.</p><p>That colour spreads through the basin.</p><p>ADAM turns his hand over in front of him and witnesses it filling with watercolour reds and pinks before settling into its proper tone.</p><p>His attention flies quickly up the wall, which now appears to have creamy toned watercolours cascading down it.</p><p>In the mirror, we see ADAM's face as a sketch at first.</p><p>His eyes fill in with colour first as we are drawn closer to the image. They turn a glistening, watery blue.</p><p>A moment later, the areas around his eyes flow outwards with the colour red which quickly flows across his face and turns to a more natural pink.</p><p>The image of himself in the mirror begins to stretch outward.</p><p>A seam of canvas white opens up in the stretch as ADAM is separated into two instances.</p><p>One stares into the mirror, the other swings around and looks behind itself to witness the black behind them become filled with colour.</p><p>The instance of ADAM still looking leans in closer to the image, manoeuvering out of his own way to watch the other version of himself.</p><p>The other ADAM swivels on the spot and collapses down onto the toilet seat.</p><p>ADAM looks away from the mirror to the toilet seat. There is no one there, it seems.</p><p>He too now turns and sits down on the seat.</p><p>He closes his eyes and brings his hands to his face, rubbing it in an attempt to cope with the stresses of the imagery.</p><p>His hands slide finally away from his face, having rubbed photorealistic detail back into himself.</p><h3>EXT. CHURCH - NOON</h3><p>ADAM opens his eyes and looks toward us.</p><p>In front of him, EVE is crouched with a hand on his shoulder.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Are you okay? Hello...?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>What happened?</p></div> <p>ADAM raises a hand up to his face and rubs it against his forehead, confused pain in his expression.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Oh, you might... You're bleeding a bit.</p></div> <p>ADAM examines his hand.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Can you stand?</p></div> <p>ADAM nods weakly.</p><p>EVE then helps him to his feet.</p><p>As EVE assists ADAM walking in one direction, they walk past camera and reveal behind themselves another ADAM and EVE heading in the other direction.</p><p>The other ADAM looks up at the church next to them.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Is that the church?</p></div> <h3>INT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM is sat with EVE in the hospital waiting room.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>It's been like an hour, Adam.</p></div> <p>ADAM has a plaster on his forehead, covering his wound.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's fine by now.</p></div> <p>EVE looks at ADAM.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Well, I have to go. I think you'll be all right on your own.</p></div> <p>She stands.</p><p>ADAM stands up with her.</p><p>EVE smiles at him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Very gentlemanly.</p></div> <p>ADAM smiles back at her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Give me your phone.</p></div> <p>ADAM gives his phone to EVE.</p><p>She types her number in.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Call me and let me know how it goes, okay?</p></div> <p>She gives ADAM's phone back to him.</p><p>He smiles.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, I will.</p></div> <p>EVE hugs ADAM tightly, then turns away and walks toward the exit.</p><p>ADAM sits back down.</p><p>As EVE exits through the main doors, ADAM and JENNY enter.</p><p>JENNY looks around and spots the reception.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>Go take a seat Adam. I'll get you signed in.</p></div> <p>ADAM moves over to the seating area, where previously we had seen him saying goodbye to EVE.</p><p>JENNY walks over to the reception.</p><p>ADAM is now sat down as well as stood up in front of himself.</p><p>As the second ADAM takes a seat, they merge.</p><p>He gives a sudden small gasp of pain and clutches his head.</p><p>JENNY approaches and sits down next to ADAM.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY (CONT'D)</h4><p>Hey, are you okay?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, I...</p></div> <p>A nurse turns from down a corridor.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>NURSE</h4><p>Jones? Adam Jones?</p></div> <h3>EXT. WAR TORN PARIS - DAWN</h3><p>JONES stands as a man amongst a line of troops.</p><p>The GENERAL is stood in front of him and talking to him in a bid to comfort him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>GENERAL</h4><p>Jones!</p></div> <p>JONES looks back to the general.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONES</h4><p>Sir?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>GENERAL</h4><p>I can't promise you life, Jones, but I do promise you survival for centuries ahead of us.</p></div> <p>JONES swallows his fear and stands upright, suppressing his trembling.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONES</h4><p>Sir, thank you, sir!</p></div> <p>The GENERAL turns back up the line of troops and sets off to march up them and away.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>GENERAL</h4><p>All right, men; move out!</p></div> <p>The troops move out in separate directions to take their positions.</p><p>JONES falters for a movement as he steps ahead slowly.</p><p>He looks around himself with a slight confusion, and pauses briefly to look upward at the sky.</p><p>Another SOLDIER moves up behind JONES.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>SOLDIER</h4><p>See you in another life, yeah Jones?</p></div> <p>The SOLDIER moves quickly past as JONES catches himself and looks onward at the soldier.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONES</h4><p>In another life...</p></div> <p>JONES raises his gun to hold it securely, then sets off into motion out toward battle.</p><h3>INT. JONNY'S ROOM - AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM is sat playing a war game on a games console.</p><p>JEFF is sat up on the sofa, smoking a spliff.</p><p>JENNY is next to him and looking toward ADAM.</p><p>JONNY now is laid back on his bed, a history book laid open but not being read beside him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>You sure we shouldn't get you to a hospital, Adam?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JEFF</h4><p>Nah, look at him... Adam, take off your plaster.</p></div> <p>ADAM turns to JENNY and JEFF.</p><p>He peels off the plaster on his forehead.</p><p>JEFF smiles.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JEFF (CONT'D)</h4><p>Good as new, see?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>Okay then.</p></div> <p>ADAM turns back to the war game.</p><h3>INT. LECTURE THEATRE - DAY</h3><p>ADAM is looking, with a bored, lazy expression at his notebook.</p><p>He is scribbling a note.</p><p>âFree will. Make a decision. Defy destiny!â</p><p>The TUTOR turns to the white board and picks up a pen.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR</h4><p>Now then... Schrodinger's cat!</p></div> <p>The TUTOR begins to draw two images on the board, one the inverse of the other, each a single point with lines come out from it at angles; forwards from the first point and backwards from the second.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>The first two ideas I want to relate to you are multiple worlds theory, and multiple histories.</p></div> <p>He turns back to the class.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>One suggests that every decision you make is actually made in all the multitude of different ways it could possibly be made. And the other suggests the same thing, but extends the idea to assume that the reality you now inhabit could've come to be out of multiple, different histories. Different decisions leading you to the same conclusions.</p></div> <p>ADAM perks up and starts paying attention.</p><p>He raises a hand.</p><p>The TUTOR looks to him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Adam?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>So, you're kind of suggesting... Certain events might be pre-ordained, where in the meantime we have actual options?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR</h4><p>That's practically correct. But are they options really, if they all happen anyway?</p></div> <p>ADAM has no further questions and the TUTOR turns back to the rest of the class ready to continue.</p><p>ADAM stares for a few moments of contemplation, out of the window.</p><h3>EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY</h3><p>ADAM is turned away from EVE and staring across the park.</p><p>EVE is turned toward ADAM, sat on the bench alongside him.</p><p>EVE draws from a spliff.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Higher dimensional butterflies sound gorgeous. I suppose everything seems more connected in the higher dimensions.</p></div> <p>ADAM nods slightly in acknowledgement.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>We could all be as one, a collected consciousness. A single mind, separated by the imagining of a material existence.</p></div> <p>ADAM loses his thoughts and his expression turns to a mildly confused sort of horror.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Fucking... No... No. Eve, I gotta go.</p></div> <p>EVE stirs from her seat.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Well hey, uhmm...</p></div> <p>She considers the spliff in her hand then looks back to ADAM, offering him it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Finish it off?</p></div> <p>ADAM takes it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Thanks.</p></div> <p>He draws from the spliff and stands.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>I'm gonna be so fucked up for class.</p></div> <p>EVE stands.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Promise me you'll ring me again.</p></div> <p>She smiles at ADAM.</p><p>ADAM smiles back and finishes the spliff. He flicks the end away.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I will.</p></div> <p>They awkwardly go to hug one another.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>See you later, then.</p></div> <p>She kisses ADAM, a peck on the cheek.</p><p>Their embrace finishes, EVE smiles at ADAM.</p><p>She picks up her bag and sets off away from him.</p><p>ADAM stares at her leaving for a moment.</p><p>She turns back to him and approaches him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Hey, why don't you bunk off? You can spend the afternoon with me.</p></div> <p>One instance of ADAM is now turned and walking away towards uni, another instance of EVE is headed in the opposite direction.</p><p>Between them, this ADAM and EVE stand and remain together.</p><p>ADAM is contemplating the thought.</p><p>He casts a glance over his shoulder and looks toward where the other version of himself is still leaving.</p><p>He turns back to EVE.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, all right then.</p></div> <p>He smiles at her and she smiles back.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Come on then.</p></div> <p>She grabs him by the wrist and leads him further into the park.</p><h3>EXT. THE PARK - DAY</h3><p>ADAM and EVE are lay on the grass, looking up at the sky.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>You remember, you met me at the church when I hit my head?</p></div> <p>EVE turns to ADAM, smiling gleefully.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Yeah.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I'd kinda been flying. You said,...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>I said it's quite a strain on the mind to create a universe.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks to EVE.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, only a second before that I'd actually been like... Flying up through the universe. What did you mean, anyway?</p></div> <p>EVE turns back onto her back and looks up at the sky.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>I'm sure you'll figure it out. I only kinda guessed you must have passed out due to weed. I could smell it on you.</p></div> <p>EVE turns back to ADAM.</p><p>She grins at him for a moment.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>So maybe I was just fucking with you.</p></div> <p>She turns away and drops the smile.</p><p>ADAM too turns back to the sky.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>So, what would you be doing if you'd gone to class today?</p></div> <h3>INT. LECTURE THEATRE - DAY</h3><p>The TUTOR stands at the front of the class.</p><p>ADAM and other students fill the seats in the room.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR</h4><p>So then, taking the example of a cat in a box, when we open that box the multiple histories of Schrodinger's cat can collapse into one state - one observation which has to be made upon opening the box. Either the cat is alive, or it's dead. In the mean time, the cat could have done all manner of things if we choose to believe it can play out its options, but at that crunching moment those histories may as well be merged into one. Doing so, merging multiple options into one definite state, would probably save the universe a great energy cost. We talked about how the super-massive and the miniscule could be one in the same state, and that's fairly perfect as a description to me; it means our world is the consequence of unresolved perspective. If you consider Occam's razor and apply it to everything you've learnt recently, you end up with one final consequence; one solution to the equation. Everything else cancels itself out...</p></div> <h3>EXT. EVE'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM and EVE walk up the path that leads to her place.</p><p>They enter the gate as they chat.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>What is it you study?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Philosophy of Science.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Wow. The weird, wonderful world of QM, eh?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's not just QM, but yeah... Pretty much.</p></div> <p>EVE opens her front door and allows ADAM to walk in first.</p><p>Once inside, she closes the door behind them.</p><h3>INT. EVE'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM and EVE are sat on the sofa.</p><p>She is closing the distance between their bodies, while pretending her interest was in petting ERWIN on ADAM's lap.</p><p>EVE closes the distance and begins to kiss ADAM; a passionate snogging ensues briefly.</p><p>She finally pulls away only slightly, and with her hand she shoes ERWIN off of ADAM's lap.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>We can take our wine upstairs.</p></div> <p>ADAM smiles, gazing into EVE's gaze.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Okay.</p></div> <p>He kisses her again, passionately, as she starts to stand.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, she steps back from ADAM and takes his hand.</p><p>She leads him up and then out of the room.</p><h3>EXT. EVE'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM and EVE walk up the road to Eve's place, from in the opposite direction to their former instances of self.</p><p>They also seem far more giddy and romantically entwined with one another than the former too.</p><p>ADAM is already kissing EVE at the gate, as she fumbles blindly to open it.</p><p>She leads him up the path to her door, still caught in youthful passions.</p><p>She turns to the door and plays with her keys to find the keyhole.</p><p>After a moment, she has it open then leads ADAM inside and slams closed the door behind them.</p><h3>INT.

Let me know you're okay.</p></div> <p>She looks to ADAM and smiles, then extends his phone back to him.</p><p>He takes it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah, I will.</p></div> <p>EVE turns about the room looking at the people in it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>All right then, I guess I'll be seeing you.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Bye.</p></div> <p>JONNY stirs from his book for a moment.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONNY</h4><p>Yeah, see you.</p></div> <p>He returns to the book.</p><p>JENNY stands.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>I'll see you out.</p></div> <p>EVE and JENNY leave the room.</p><p>ADAM turns back to the television to watch as JEFF plays his game.</p><p>JONNY turns a page in his book.</p><h3>EXT. WAR TORN PARIS - DAWN</h3><p>A SOLDIER crouches behind cover in a Parisian street.</p><p>He is looking back and shouting.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>SOLDIER</h4><p>Jones! Jones!</p></div> <p>We move out to see JONES looking about into the sky, a look of deep terror on his face.</p><p>The soldier stands and runs to him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>SOLDIER (CONT'D)</h4><p>Dammit, Jones!</p></div> <p>He pulls JONES back into the safety of cover.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>SOLDIER (CONT'D)</h4><p>Just what the fuck do you think you're doing?</p></div> <p>JONES slumps down into the cover.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONES</h4><p>I can't do this. I can't fucking handle it.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>SOLDIER</h4><p>This is not the time, Jones.</p></div> <p>The SOLDIER looks over the cover and down the street.</p><p>They are in relative safety but the sounds of war are loud around them.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONES</h4><p>I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.</p></div> <p>JONES looks square into the eyes of the other SOLDIER.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JONES (CONT'D)</h4><p>It's been a privilege, but I'm sorry.</p></div> <p>JONES stands up quickly and runs back down the street, fumbling with a packet on his belt.</p><p>The soldier mumbles under his breath.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>SOLDIER</h4><p>Dammit, Jones, you're going to get yourself killed.</p></div> <p>Our view sways and rumbles as we join JONES' perspective.</p><p>The street rushes by us for an instant, before we look to our hand; a grenade clutched within it.</p><p>Our other hand pulls the pin and we watch as the grenade drops to the ground directly beneath us.</p><h3>INT. JONNY'S ROOM - AFTERNOON</h3><p>On the television screen, a grenade blows up at the ground a game character's feet.</p><p>The soldier's body flies up and contorts in the air.</p><p>JEFF slumps back into his beanbag.</p><p>JENNY has just reentered the room.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JENNY</h4><p>I'm sure that's not the point of the game.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JEFF</h4><p>I bore easily.</p></div> <p>He pauses the game and turns to JENNY and JONNY.</p><p>He shoots a quick look to ADAM on the sofa and then looks back to JONNY, as the group's central focus point.</p><p>JONNY looks up from his book at JEFF.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>JEFF (CONT'D)</h4><p>Spliff?</p></div> <h3>EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY</h3><p>ADAM looks straight through our view and talks to camera.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Habits follow us everywhere.</p></div> <p>The view pulls back slowly from ADAM.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>We escape everything else, but our habits...</p></div> <p>He looks down and then raises a spliff to his mouth and draws from it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>No matter where we go, no matter what the time, the habit can still occur. It's a collection of instances. Like... a pattern of coordinates on this four dimensional graph.</p></div> <p>We are drawn further and further out to reveal ADAM is sat on a bench with EVE sat next to him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>They create these shapes. Y'know these ugly habits are a form of order in chaos. And they create these shapes, intricate and... beautiful. Like massive, higher-dimensional butterflies.</p></div> <p>The camera lowers as it draws away from ADAM and we see that he is not looking into us, but now over.</p><p>He hands the spliff to EVE and turns to her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>I like this.</p></div> <p>He smiles.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>I like it too. I'm glad you're okay.</p></div> <p>ADAM turns back away from EVE and stares across the park.</p><p>EVE draws from the spliff.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Higher dimensional butterflies sound gorgeous. I suppose everything seems more connected in the higher dimensions.</p></div> <p>ADAM nods slightly in acknowledgement.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>We could all be as one, a collected consciousness. A single mind, separated by the imagining of a material existence.</p></div> <p>ADAM loses his thoughts and his expression turns to a mildly confused sort of horror.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Fucking... No... No. Eve, I gotta go.</p></div> <p>EVE stirs from her seat.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Well hey, uhmm...</p></div> <p>She considers the spliff in her hand then looks back to ADAM, offering him it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Finish it off?</p></div> <p>ADAM takes it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Thanks.</p></div> <p>He draws from the spliff and stands.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>I'm gonna be so fucked up for class.</p></div> <p>EVE stands.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Promise me you'll ring me again.</p></div> <p>She smiles at ADAM.</p><p>ADAM smiles back and finishes the spliff. He flicks the end away.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I will.</p></div> <p>They awkwardly go to hug one another.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>See you later, then.</p></div> <p>She kisses ADAM, a peck on the cheek.</p><p>Their embrace finishes, EVE smiles at ADAM.</p><p>She picks up her bag and sets off away from him.</p><p>ADAM stares at her leaving for a moment.</p><p>He then picks up his own backpack and sets off in the other direction.</p><h3>INT. LECTURE THEATRE - DAY</h3><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR</h4><p>Reality!</p></div> <p>The TUTOR stands at the head of the class.</p><p>The class, including ADAM, are sat in seats and listening to his words.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>...within a reality, within a reality! We all know that astrologers attempt to use the stars to tell us our personalities and our daily fate. The idea that large scale structures in the celestial plains can be read as a sequence of patterns which correspond to patterns within our every day lives. I can look around this room and assume that at least eighty percent of you don't give a damn about your horoscope; you don't believe in it. I agree, it's all some fanciful shit that came out of the imaginings of history before there was science to shine a light on the purpose of the stars and why we should behave the way we do. But hey, lets not rule it out. Lets take a moment and consider fractals.</p></div> <p>The TUTOR turns to a white board and picks up a pen.</p><p>He draws a circle.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>We assume this is our world, our universe at its current size. Of course we know it's expanding still at a rapid rate, so in the future...</p></div> <p>He draws a vertical line down the board to the far right of the circle.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>In the future, we have a super-super-massive universe. And we know the universe is expanding towards this because we've looked at the stars and have determined that...</p></div> <p>He puts a single dot, a point, to the left of the circle.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>This was the universe thirteen point seven billion years ago. From the utterly miniscule and practically non-existant, to the vast universe we know and witness today, and onwards to its potentially inevitable heat death; an expansion back into practical non-existence.</p></div> <p>He puts the cap back on his pen and puts it down then turns to the class.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Now, you all know that's not the only option. But if it is, a lot of theorists tell us that this is the end. Heat death results in nothing but a vacuum; the odd scattered particles have been torn back out of existence and space itself has destabilised - it is no more. That is exactly why a more recent theory has come to light which suggests that this over here...</p></div> <p>He gestures to the vertical line.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>And this, way back here...</p></div> <p>He walks over to and indicates toward the dot.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Are actually one in the same state. Because if space doesn't exist, scale is irrelevant. In essence, our expansion towards an ever-larger universe is merely an illusion. We are in fact expanding back towards the same state as when our universe was miniscule, thirteen point seven billion years ago. The massive and the tiny are one in the same. Our perception, because we are here...</p></div> <p>He points firmly to the circle, giving the board a hard stab.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Sees the same exact thing in two starkly contrasting ways. And imagine that great expanse, which is equally a miniscule non-existence, is going to yield a universe all over again which will expand from the nothing and outwards to a great expanse and be nothing once again. We are, proverbially speaking, living in one shell of an infinitely recurring Babushka Doll.</p></div> <p>There is a murmur of laughter from amongst the class.</p><p>ADAM does not laugh.</p><p>He clutches his head in his hand and stares vacantly at a corner of the room and across the ceiling.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>So then, maybe there's something to reading the stars after all. If size at its grandest scales is merely an illusion, why can't we think of the stars as like people or of ourselves as like the stars, merely a smaller, microcosmic recurrence of the same pattern across the universe's grander scales and down, and down, and down again. Perhaps a class of neutrinos right now, are listening to an electron yammer on about the same stupid philosophy.</p></div> <p>The TUTOR picks up an eraser from the board's shelf.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>TUTOR (CONT'D)</h4><p>Now, lets look at how these notions of scale and interconnectivity can be re-attributed back to Schrodinger's cat.</p></div> <p>He wipes the content from the whiteboard, meticulously.</p><h3>INT. EVE'S PLACE - LATE AFTERNOON</h3><p>ADAM and EVE enter her place through the front door.</p><p>She closes it behind them once ADAM is in.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Living room's that way.</p></div> <p>She indicates to an open door.</p><p>ADAM walks through.</p><p>EVE locks the door and follows in after ADAM.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Have a seat.</p></div> <p>ADAM sits on the sofa.</p><p>A cat, ERWIN, enters the room from the kitchen area.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>Ah, the hunter has returned.</p></div> <p>EVE moves to ERWIN and picks him up.</p><p>She gives the cat to ADAM. He rests the cat on his lap.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>The hunter?</p></div> <p>EVE meanders through to the kitchen.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Yeah, he's a beast. Comes and goes as he pleases. Fitting, really.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>How so?</p></div> <p>ADAM is stroking the cat on his lap.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>I've called him Erwin, after Schrodinger's cat.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks toward the kitchen briefly and then back at ERWIN.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>I know Schrodinger's cat didn't have a name. That's why I had to name him after Schrodinger.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I didn't realise you were so into quantum mechanics.</p></div> <p>EVE reenters the room with two glasses of wine.</p><p>She offers one to ADAM and he takes it.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>There's a lot more that we have in common. I guess you haven't realised yet.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks at EVE with a perplexed grin.</p><p>He looks back to ERWIN, still petting him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's sort of weird, thinking about what we have in common... With animals and each other, I guess.</p></div> <p>EVE sips from her wine.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Mm-hmm.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>We're all kind of connected. Their minds and ours. It all boils down to fundamental, instinctual level psychology. We all live, we all die.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>And in the meantime, we look for something to fuck.</p></div> <p>ADAM looks to EVE.</p><p>EVE grins at ADAM.</p><p>ADAM offers her the same perplexed smile again.</p><p>EVE leans across the sofa to stroke ERWIN.</p><p>She leans closer still to ADAM.</p><p>Their faces, close to touching; her eyes glance to his mouth.</p><p>His eyes glance to hers and both return to lock sights back within one another's gaze.</p><p>EVE closes the distance and begins to kiss ADAM; a passionate snogging ensues briefly.</p><p>She finally pulls away only slightly, and with her hand she shoes ERWIN off of ADAM's lap.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>We can take our wine upstairs.</p></div> <p>ADAM smiles, gazing into EVE's gaze.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Okay.</p></div> <p>He kisses her again, passionately, as she starts to stand.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, she steps back from ADAM and takes his hand.</p><p>She leads him up and then out of the room.</p><h3>EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NOON</h3><p>ADAM stands close to the edge of the rooftop.</p><p>EVE is behind him.</p><p>He looks out over the scenery as she looks onward to him.</p><p>Scaffolding surrounds the quiet, inactive building.</p><p>The mood is calm, nature seems serene.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>You can see all the world from up here.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>I know.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>No.</p></div> <p>He turns to her and steps closer to her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>I mean, the whole world is filling my head. I don't just see it all. I can almost feel it.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Adam, I know.</p></div> <p>She steps toward him and takes his hand.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>It'll all be fine.</p></div> <p>ADAM appears sombre.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>There's a world larger than this one, I think. Larger, and smaller... Larger than the whole universe... As small as nothing.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>It doesn't have to be nothing.</p></div> <p>ADAM turns away from her, slipping out of the grasp of her hand.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's not real though, is it? This one.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>What is real, Adam?</p></div> <p>ADAM sits at the edge of the building, looking out.</p><p>EVE walks across and sits next to him, dangling her legs over the side.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I'd like to think I'm real... And you're real. I dunno about any of that. But the world; I don't think it can be.</p></div> <p>EVE takes ADAM's hand again.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>The world needs an observer.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Schrodinger's cat, right?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Yeah... Always Schrodinger's cat. Everything...</p></div> <p>ADAM takes a pouch of tobacco and some papers from his pocket, letting go of EVE's hand once more.</p><p>He begins to roll a cigarette.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>Repeating patterns, emerged from nothing and returning again... To nothing. Remember habits?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>Like butterflies, right?</p></div> <p>ADAM looks to EVE.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>Nothing would've been worthwhile, if not for the beauty of it all.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>It'll still be here tomorrow... Or whenever you might end up. Beauty will remain here to behold if you let it.</p></div> <p>ADAM licks the skin of his cigarette and rolls it sealed.</p><p>He stands up and removes a lighter from his pocket.</p><p>He sparks up his cigarette and looks out across the world.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>It's almost noon... the great beholder will know himself soon... or herself... or whatever the fuck!</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>It doesn't matter.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>I know. We're not there yet.</p></div> <p>EVE stands up and faces ADAM.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM (CONT'D)</h4><p>Babushka dolls, Eve.</p></div> <p>EVE smiles at him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>And the world looking in, as though ours were the world below.</p></div> <p>ADAM smiles back at her.</p><p>He casts a glance directly down camera.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>They see us?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ADAM</h4><p>They see us.</p></div> <p>We see now from ADAM's perspective, EVE looking directly at us.</p><p>EVE turns away from camera and takes a few steps.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE</h4><p>But they still don't know.</p></div> <p>A haze of whitenoise starts to fill the screen like old TV static; the hiss starts to come through in audio.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EVE (CONT'D)</h4><p>And the world woke up, and it was nothing yet; just a story...</p></div> <p>The static finally overpowers all other video and audio.</p>"},"dir":"/_data/screenplays/last-thursday","path":"/_data/screenplays/last-thursday/episode-4","extension":".fountain","createdAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.248Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191194},"$loki":91},{"slug":"1622498285726","_id":"46fc6290-c25b-11eb-837d-1987b70bf6b8","name":"Thom Bruce","message":"This is another test comment.","createdAt":"2021-05-31T21:58:05.723Z","dir":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module","path":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module/1622498285726","extension":".yml","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.244Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191195},"$loki":92},{"slug":"1622514678226","_id":"71adfe10-c281-11eb-8b31-89c4b1062be9","name":"Thom Bruce","message":"This comment tests the functioning of insertion into the store.","createdAt":"2021-06-01T02:31:18.220Z","dir":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module","path":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module/1622514678226","extension":".yml","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.244Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191195},"$loki":93},{"slug":"1622515132757","_id":"809f6980-c282-11eb-8b31-89c4b1062be9","name":"Thom Bruce","message":"Let's try inserting another comment.","createdAt":"2021-06-01T02:38:52.752Z","dir":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module","path":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module/1622515132757","extension":".yml","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.244Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191195},"$loki":94},{"slug":"1622515207656","_id":"ad4aa760-c282-11eb-8b31-89c4b1062be9","name":"Thom Bruce","message":"One final insertion test to see the form clear...","createdAt":"2021-06-01T02:40:07.656Z","dir":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module","path":"/_data/comments/blog/my-first-nuxt-module/1622515207656","extension":".yml","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.244Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191195},"$loki":95},{"slug":"1620908260114","_id":"35cea570-b3e5-11eb-9714-a5345a0b987b","name":"Final Test","message":"This one should be merged automatically, no moderation required...","createdAt":"2021-05-13T12:17:40.114Z","dir":"/_data/comments/blog/website-checklist","path":"/_data/comments/blog/website-checklist/1620908260114","extension":".yml","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.244Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191196},"$loki":96},{"slug":"1620910954749","_id":"7c065b90-b3eb-11eb-84bb-5d820e70cc39","name":"Emoji Test","message":"Can I add emojis and various kinds of formatting...\n\nLike this new paragraph? ð¸","createdAt":"2021-05-13T13:02:34.745Z","dir":"/_data/comments/blog/website-checklist","path":"/_data/comments/blog/website-checklist/1620910954749","extension":".yml","updatedAt":"2021-06-01T06:47:30.244Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1622530191196},"$loki":97},{"slug":"incubation","title":"Incubation","credit":"written by","author":"Thom Bruce","authors":"Thom Bruce","draft_date":"2011-05-01","date":"2011-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","html":{"title_page":"<h1>Incubation</h1><p class=\"credit\">written by</p><p class=\"authors\">Thom Bruce</p><p class=\"draft-date\">2011-05-01</p>","script":"<h3>INT.

GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>ANANKE opens the refrigerator unit's door and retrieves a collection of test tubes.</p><p>She places the test tubes and their rack upon a steel desk.</p><p>One by one, a pipe is placed into each of the test tubes, meeting with the liquid within them.</p><p>A button is pressed.</p><p>The contents of a test tube are drained and transported to a machine, designed to incubate the fluid.</p><p>This happens in turn for the rest of the test tubes, as the next button is pressed sequentially along its row.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - DIM FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>Within one chamber of the incubating machine, a form can be seen to be growing.</p><p>It is growing, this action accelerated, from invisibly microscopic.</p><p>At first, no form can be determined.</p><p>Soon, stumps have formed and an entity with four limbs begins to take shape.</p><p>It grows to resemble a human foetus and continues to take shape in this vein.</p><p>Altogether, there appear to be twenty-two active chambers with another three unlit, inactive.</p><p>Each chamber glows and contains a rapidly growing life-form, each a human baby.</p><p>This is except for one chamber which appears to contain conjoined twins.</p><p>The chamber containing conjoined twins is seen in detail.</p><p>The twins within grow, with time still rapidly increased, and become more separate with time.</p><p>The two life-forms ultimately separate into independent units.</p><p>Their forms grow around one another in the chamber as they become full-sized babies, struggling for space.</p><p>In other units, the respective life-forms comfortably grow to be full-sized babies.</p><p>The passage of time is slowed, not quite returned to normal as the lights are turned on.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>A group of technicians now, ANANKE among them, approach each of the chambers in turn.</p><p>Their motion is accelerated as they remove the babies from their chambers.</p><p>Each baby is then moved to a larger chamber, one which a fully grown adult might fit comfortably within.</p><p>The twins are separated so that twenty-three incubation chambers are occupied in total.</p><p>Each infant has a series of wires connected to it as it lays in the base of a chamber.</p><p>These incubation chambers are then closed and sealed.</p><p>The technicians, and ANANKE, leave the lab as the lower area of each chamber is partially filled with liquid.</p><p>The lights are switched off.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - DIM FLUORESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>Time is accelerated once more as each infant grows at the base of its respective incubation chamber.</p><p>They become toddlers as we focus on details of their growth.</p><p>Fingers become less stubby, elongating with development.</p><p>Arms lengthen.</p><p>Legs lengthen.</p><p>Facial features become defined.</p><p>Eyelashes grow out of eyelids.</p><p>Eyebrows grow above the eyes.</p><p>Toenails appear trimmed and then grow rapidly, then appear trimmed again as we see the foot lengthen and widen.</p><p>Hair on heads grows, then appears cut, grows again and then appears cut again as the faces it frames grow and change.</p><p>In each chamber, postpubertal forms now stand and grow taller.</p><p>As the acceleration of time slows, all are adults with their heads shaved.</p><p>Their hair grows, but not by much before...</p><p>One of the men inside one of the chambers wakes up.</p><p>This man is ZAGREUS.</p><h3>INT. ZAGREUS' INCUBATION CHAMBER - DEEP BLUE LIGHT</h3><p>We look from roughly ZAGREUS' perspective, turning across the window and searching the outside room.</p><p>Out there, there are several strange, blurred chambers, each seeming to contain a bipedal life-form.</p><p>Inside this chamber, the echo of ZAGREUS' breathing can be heard rapidly increasing.</p><p>ZAGREUS leans forward and we see his reflection form in the glass in front of him.</p><p>His face comes to meet the reflection with a shocked expression and with his breathing quickly fogging the glass.</p><p>His reflection becomes obscured due to condensation.</p><p>ZAGREUS raises a limp wrist to the chamber door, looking down to his own limbs with the same look of panic and confusion.</p><p>A sudden hiss is heard and ZAGREUS flinches wildly within his chamber.</p><p>The next moment comes and the chamber door is taken away from him.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - DIM INCANDESCENT LIGHTING</h3><p>ZAGREUS falls violently out from his chamber.</p><p>His form collapses to the floor, limp and in slow writhing.</p><p>The expression of panic on ZAGREUS' face turns to a great childlike misery.</p><p>He whimpers at first.</p><p>And then ZAGREUS cries as though a baby.</p><p>A hiss is heard from across the room.</p><p>And then another hiss, closer.</p><p>And another.</p><p>Mechanical whirrings sound as chamber doors open.</p><p>ZAGREUS is weeping, his head motioning with his eyes trying to lift his vision to see and failing.</p><p>Bodies can be heard falling to the floor, smacking against the cold steel grates.</p><p>More whimpers and crying occurs from around the room as more hisses sound to signal the opening of yet more chambers.</p><p>ZAGREUS attempts to move his form to see.</p><p>He raises a limp arm and forces his wrist against the floor but is unable to push himself up.</p><p>He rolls back into his collapsing arm and continues to whimper, and cry more loudly.</p><p>From above, we can see the assortment of men and women now lying naked, faces toward the floors.</p><p>Their bodies writhe weakly as they cry.</p><p>A final chamber hisses and then whirs open.</p><p>A female form, HARMONIA, falls out and is motionless against the ground.</p><p>In total, seven forms are motionless; the males, EPAPHUS, LATINUS, ARGUS and PELASGUS, the females, HARMONIA, HEROPHILE and ALAGONIA.</p><p>Sixteen forms remain alive and writhe upon the ground, weeping. They are the males, ZAGREUS, APOLLO, ORION, HERMES, HEPHAESTUS, twins AMPHION and ZETHUS, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON, LOCRUS and GRACEUS, and the females, ARTEMIS, ATHENA, MELINOE, THEBE and KEROESSA.</p><p>Each of the sixteen living forms writhes upon the floor and cries as though a baby, but can do nothing more.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>ZAGREUS is lay upon the ground, his eyes closed with eye-lids fluttering.</p><p>His face shows discomfort despite the rest.</p><p>Around the laboratory, whimpers and whines can still be heard.</p><p>APOLLO is collapsed near to a wall.</p><p>He raises an arm up and clutches at a lab coat hung from the wall.</p><p>Clumsily, APOLLO pulls himself up onto his knees and forces his arms to lock and hold himself upright.</p><p>He looks around the room, an expression of terrible fear upon his face, his eyes red from crying.</p><p>Near to APOLLO is a woman who looks familiar to him.</p><p>This woman is ARTEMIS, his sister.</p><p>He looks to her and she looks back at him, each struck with fear and sadness.</p><p>APOLLO crawls to ARTEMIS.</p><p>She quakes, shivering with fear at his approach.</p><p>He rests his hand on her face and caresses it somewhat violently.</p><p>At this, ARTEMIS flinches and struggles to turn her head away.</p><p>APOLLO takes back his hand, apologetically.</p><p>He rests into himself, perching uncomfortably, and begins to cry.</p><p>His cry wails loudly within the laboratory.</p><p>ZAGREUS' eyes open, startled from his slumber.</p><p>He turns his face toward APOLLO and stares, then beginning to cry himself.</p><p>Crying, and seeing that APOLLO is sat up, ZAGREUS attempts to lift himself and mimic the position of APOLLO.</p><p>He forces his body up with his arms and attempts to drag his legs under himself.</p><p>Failing, he collapses.</p><p>But he tries again, this time succeeding in holding himself up long enough to sit perched on his legs.</p><p>He shows an expression of great pain while managing this.</p><p>Then the expression of pain recedes back into his whimpered cry.</p><p>He looks to APOLLO and wails loudly.</p><p>APOLLO is startled from his own wailing, and it is diminished into just a whimper.</p><p>He looks to ZAGREUS.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks back at APOLLO as they each keep from crying.</p><p>They recognise accomplishment in one another and feel pride enough to refrain from further wailing.</p><p>ZAGREUS bows his head, choking on his prevented tears.</p><p>He examines his own body; the arms which hold him up and the legs which he places himself upon to sit.</p><p>He looks to his own sister, MELINOE, who faces away from him, and to HEPHAESTUS who lays toward his other side and looks toward him.</p><p>ZAGREUS crawls to HEPHAESTUS as HEPHAESTUS looks toward him, whimpering.</p><p>ZAGREUS then takes his hand and places it on HEPHAESTUS' arm.</p><p>He shifts HEPHAESTUS' arm, attempting to match the position of his own which still supports himself.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS understands and takes ZAGREUS' lead.</p><p>He helps to shift his own arms below himself.</p><p>Then he takes it upon himself to push the weight of his torso upwards.</p><h3>INT. GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>APOLLO and ARTEMIS are sat facing one another.</p><p>Their tear ducts are long dried up but grief still falls upon their faces.</p><p>ARTEMIS is softly examining APOLLO's face with her hand as he rests with his own hand on her shoulder.</p><p>He examines the space around them, the room and others in it.</p><p>ARTEMIS moves her hand down APOLLO's face and neck, and finds a branding below his left collar-bone.</p><p>She pressures the branding, rubbing her fingers into the word - âAPOLLOâ.</p><p>APOLLO looks down to his collar-bone, where ARTEMIS is applying pressure.</p><p>He removes his own hand from her shoulder and brings it to his branding.</p><p>Then he looks back to ARTEMIS, to her collar bone, and raises his hand to where she is branded.</p><p>He gently strokes the word written on her - âARTEMISâ.</p><p>Across the room, HEPHAESTUS is helping the twins, AMPHION and ZETHUS, to get themselves upright.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS pays note to the fact that AMPHION and ZETHUS are identical, looking back from one to the other with a curiosity forming from behind his grief.</p><p>He looks to others in the room who are not identical, and back to the twins as he helps them to sit upright.</p><p>ZAGREUS also is helping others to sit upright.</p><p>Having tended to HERMES, he sees ATHENA managing to get herself aloft but crawls to her in offering of his service.</p><p>Behind ZAGREUS, MELINOE is sat looking away from the living men and women now finding their way upright.</p><p>She is instead looking toward the dead with a look of sombre contemplation on her face.</p><h3>INT.

GENETIC LABORATORY - LATER</h3><p>Across the room from ZAGREUS, APOLLO, ORION, HEPHAESTUS and ARTEMIS, ATHENA is still stood against the wall.</p><p>ATHENA has helped THEBE, LOCRUS and AMPHION to stand and they support themselves clumsily along the wall beside her.</p><p>As ATHENA looks across the room to HEPHAESTUS and the others, AMPHION is helping his twin brother ZETHUS to stand.</p><p>As AMPHION hoists ZETHUS upwards, ATHENA steps forwards.</p><p>She collapses downwards to the floor but catches herself in as controlled a form as she can.</p><p>She rests on her hands and feet in a squat-like position.</p><p>From this position, she steps and hops clumsily across the room toward HEPHAESTUS, ZAGREUS and those others still standing by the door and lab-coats.</p><p>ZAGREUS turns his gaze from ATHENA toward MELINOE, his sister.</p><p>He too now collapses from the wall and squats.</p><p>He hops toward MELINOE, who is examining the lifeless forms of ALAGONIA and HARMONIA.</p><p>ATHENA arrives at the doorway next to HEPHAESTUS.</p><p>She raises her hand up it and presses, collecting her weight and standing.</p><p>Standing with her weight against the door, she looks into a window in it and catches sight of her reflection.</p><p>ATHENA leans in to look at her reflection and raises a hand to the glass in greeting it.</p><p>But it is cold, and a shock to her that this other person doesn't feel warm like others.</p><p>She rests her hand there as condensation fogs the glass around it.</p><p>ATHENA loses sight of the girl, her reflection, and begins to examine the rest of the door and the surrounding features.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS watches her examine the door.</p><p>ORION too watches, from his position sat on the floor by HEPHAESTUS' feet.</p><p>ARTEMIS sits next to him, with her brother APOLLO still stood beside her.</p><p>ARTEMIS looks out to ZAGREUS who attentively sits by his own sister, MELINOE.</p><p>MELINOE still shows no interest in the living and continues examining the corpse of HARMONIA.</p><p>APOLLO clutches at a lab-coat and looks down to his sister, then out to ZAGREUS and MELINOE.</p><p>He sees that ARTEMIS is clutching her legs with her arms and shivering, then looks back to the lab-coat he still clutches to keep himself stood.</p><p>Instead, he moves his hands to hold a coat-hook and tugs the lab-coat violently in a bid to remove it from the wall.</p><p>It comes loose, a key-card flying from its pocket as it manages to do so.</p><p>APOLLO pays little attention to this, but HEPHAESTUS notes it and drops to reach for it.</p><p>Ignoring this, APOLLO crouches to his sister and drapes the coat around her.</p><p>ARTEMIS looks to him as he does so and leans toward him.</p><p>She clutches the coat tightly around her and leans into APOLLO who collapses against the wall with her weight against him.</p><p>But he accepts this and sits, manoeuvring his arm to support her.</p><h3>INT.

LAB EXIT, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>A door slides open on a small structure which appears to lead underground.</p><p>Out from it, ATHENA is the first to hop onto the worn dirt at the exit.</p><p>She halts, feeling the dirt in her fingertips.</p><p>ZAGREUS follows her out of the structure, followed by HEPHAESTUS then ORION.</p><p>APOLLO and ARTEMIS are next out, moving in close proximity to one another as he tends his interest to her; her own interest is in looking upward.</p><p>Trees extend high into the bright white above them, a light which shines in a long line straight across the sky. From this, a bright blue extends downwards towards the two horizons either side of the streak of light; its bright blue diminishing into a deep, dark navy colour into the distances.</p><p>ATHENA leans toward the ground and sniffs it; she continues to sniff it as if there is some greatly invigorating scent coming from the dirt.</p><p>She licks the ground, then swirls it in her mouth a second before spitting.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS meanwhile has made his way to the grass.</p><p>He hears ATHENA spit and turns to see her. Then he turns back to the grass and picks some; he places it in his mouth.</p><p>Holding his fingers to his mouth as he chews, he continues to search the grass with his eyes then finds a tree extending from the ground.</p><p>He hops towards it, places one hand against it then leans in to the tree.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS licks the tree, then recoils from its taste and texture.</p><p>ZAGREUS moves beyond HEPHAESTUS, into the trees. He looks into the forest, contemplative of the surroundings.</p><p>Far in the distance, there is darkness, but the trees remain lightly packed enough to let through a generous helping of light nearby. Still, they are dense enough to conceal hidden threats.</p><p>As APOLLO and ARTEMIS make their way toward the grass where HEPHAESTUS continues to sample the flavours of grass and flowers, APOLLO halts.</p><p>ARTEMIS continues and stops at the grass, crouching to sniff it.</p><p>APOLLO remains still, thrusting himself somewhat upright and looking towards a line of trees and bushes.</p><p>There is a rustling from beyond the bushes.</p><p>ORION too now looks toward the bushes with APOLLO, and ARTEMIS raises herself from the grass to look.</p><p>A sheep suddenly darts out from the bushes and bounds through the opening.</p><p>It halts as it is startled by the group.</p><p>ORION leans forward as though to begin a motion toward the sheep.</p><p>But quickly the sheep bounds away again, darting through the group and back into the trees.</p><p>There is a growl from beyond the bushes and a rustling once more.</p><p>Then a dog, of a sheep herding breed but now wild, emerges quickly and on the hunt.</p><p>It dashes through the group and leaps at ARTEMIS.</p><p>She is toppled to the ground.</p><p>Many of the group quickly start to hop away into the trees, many finding themselves able to run upright clumsily.</p><p>HERMES is the quickest into the trees and bounds with some show of talent for running, though supporting himself clumsily with tree branches.</p><p>MELINOE remains and watches from near the laboratory exit hatch, her expressions attentive; she leans toward the action and reaches out a concerned hand though she is far away.</p><p>ZAGREUS, ORION and APOLLO also remain.</p><p>ZAGREUS merely watches from the tree-line, while ORION is quick to bound towards ARTEMIS and the dog.</p><p>APOLLO follows quickly after ORION.</p><p>ORION leaps at the dog and throws it off ARTEMIS.</p><p>He pins it to the ground with the weight of his body, as it snaps and snarls at him.</p><p>Instinctively, he raises his hand into the air and begins slapping his palm down against the dog.</p><p>With every succession, his hand resembles a fist more and more and ORION continues to beat the dog.</p><p>APOLLO approaches ARTEMIS and helps her back upright.</p><p>She clutches at him with white-knuckled, strong, panicked grasps.</p><p>APOLLO clumsily tries to get between her grasps and pull her towards the treeline.</p><p>She is difficult to calm and to move.</p><p>Instead, APOLLO wraps his arms around her and sits with her on the floor, hugging her tightly.</p><p>As ORION beats the dog, it has since stopped moving.</p><p>ZAGREUS moves toward him, calmly and slowly.</p><p>He places his hand on ORION's shoulder and tugs him to indicate motion toward the trees, to follow the others.</p><p>ORION calms and stops beating the dog.</p><p>He looks to ZAGREUS, to the treeline, and then to ARTEMIS and APOLLO.</p><p>He leaves ZAGREUS' grasp to move toward ARTEMIS and APOLLO.</p><p>Gently he greets ARTEMIS by raising his hand to her face.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks toward MELINOE, as she moves toward him and the dead, beaten dog.</p><p>She rests beside him and looks at the dog, motionless.</p><p>Her face turns contemplative and she looks back toward ORION, who is now examining his own hand for the blood and saliva which covers it.</p><p>She looks back to the dog but catches sight of ZAGREUS extending his arm to her.</p><p>He grasps her shoulder and tugs it in the direction of the treeline.</p><p>She looks to it, indicating her understanding, then lets her brother set out first and follows him.</p><p>As they leave, ZAGREUS looks back to ORION.</p><p>ORION looks to ZAGREUS, then to APOLLO and ARTEMIS.</p><p>He puts one hand to APOLLO's shoulder then raises his other arm in the direction of the treeline.</p><p>APOLLO looks to it and understands.</p><p>He hugs ARTEMIS  more tightly, grazing his face against her cheek, then lets her loose so that they each can move to leave.</p><p>ORION sets out to follow MELINOE and ZAGREUS.</p><p>ARTEMIS watches, then looks to APOLLO, then to the treeline.</p><p>She sets out in following ORION, her brother at her side.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>HERMES darts out of the trees, and stumbles to the ground having no more branches to support his upright run.</p><p>He hits it, hard, and groans loudly.</p><p>Manoeuvring his arms slowly, he presses down against the earth and pushes his torso upwards.</p><p>He looks out ahead of himself and sees the farmhouse.</p><p>The farmhouse appears as a strange combination of rustic and ultramodern; partially constructed of wood, particularly in its frame, yet with a lot of steel and polymers apparent in its structure.</p><p>HERMES clambers into an upright squat and admires the farmhouse.</p><p>He looks behind himself, back into the forest; there is no sign of danger anymore.</p><p>He moves forward toward the farmhouse, walking across the ground on all fours.</p><p>As he reaches a fence, he uses it to hoist himself into a standing position then looks back into the forest.</p><p>He can see others still trying to dash away from the dog that had chased them.</p><p>HERMES yells to them.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HERMES</h4><p>YAAH! AAH!

THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>ZAGREUS emerges from the trees, followed by ORION and MELINOE.</p><p>He is bewildered by the farmhouse but carries on towards it.</p><p>ORION too is bewildered, staring around at the clearing the farmhouse finds itself placed within.</p><p>MELINOE appears the least interested, only passively observing her surroundings.</p><p>APOLLO and ARTEMIS soon follow them out of the trees.</p><p>ARTEMIS continues onwards, staring attentively at the surroundings and the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO stops and uses a tree to hold himself upright.</p><p>He looks with perplexed admiration at the farmhouse.</p><p>As he stares at it, he returns to his crouched position and first sets off slowly towards it, then looks to ARTEMIS.</p><p>He quickens to catch up to her.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>APOLLO, ARTEMIS, ORION, ZAGREUS, MELINOE, HELLEN and GRACEUS remain outside the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO is admiring nearby fields, with ARTEMIS sat by his side.</p><p>She rises from her sitting and moves toward the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO watches her go briefly but turns back to the fields and looks out at the expanse of land.</p><p>ORION, having been examining a disused object of technology, looks to ARTEMIS as she heads toward the farmhouse.</p><p>She arrives at the door and enters it.</p><p>ZAGREUS, who was near to the door, watches her enter and follows her inside.</p><p>MELINOE remains sat against the wall outside.</p><p>ORION too makes his way toward the farmhouse, HELLEN and GRACEUS choosing to follow him.</p><p>APOLLO casts his gaze away from the fields and up towards the sky.</p><p>It remains blue with a strong streak of white down its middle, but a moment later rain begins to fall.</p><p>APOLLO attempts to stand upwards into the rain.</p><p>He opens his mouth and lets droplets hit his tongue as the rain falls heavier.</p><p>The rain falls more and more heavily as APOLLO drinks it in.</p><p>The sky barely changes, but is ablaze with colour as the light is refracted in the rain.</p><p>APOLLO shakes himself, trying to shed the rainwater, but it persists in falling.</p><p>He tentatively puts himself in position to move indoors, but waits.</p><p>Looking up at the colours which dance across the sky, he moves slowly.</p><p>MELINOE nervously peers out from beneath the farmhouse's awning.</p><p>As APOLLO passes, he puts his hand on her arm and tugs.</p><p>She looks up to him, then collects herself.</p><p>The pair then quickly move inside and close the door behind them.</p><p>Then onwards, the only motion or sound of the outside is of the rain and the colours which dance across the sky above.</p><p>Water cascades down the roof, the wall and the windows of the little farmhouse.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY, SOMETIME MUCH LATER</h3><p>Water drips from the awning of the farmhouse into a filled bucket below.</p><p>A shadow is cast over the bucket as two hands reach for its rim.</p><p>MELINOE lifts the bucket of water.</p><p>She walks back to the front door of the farmhouse as we see that she is now basically clothed, with a non-fitting, open jacket and some trousers, precariously tied up at her waist.</p><p>APOLLO exits the front door of the farmhouse and greets MELINOE by gently stroking her face.</p><p>She smiles at his greeting.</p><p>APOLLO steps aside and allows MELINOE to enter the farmhouse.</p><p>He walks out into the open, with a strange stride as though unconfident still that his feet could support his body.</p><p>He stares towards the fields then across the forest.</p><p>ORION emerges from the forest with a freshly killed dog draped over his shoulders.</p><p>APOLLO turns and walks to where the remains of a previous dog are hung over the ashes of a dead fire.</p><p>He tears a piece of the dogs flesh away with his hands, then takes it to his mouth and eats it.</p><p>He looks back to ORION at the edge of the forest and sees his sister, ARTEMIS, following the huntsman.</p><p>APOLLO strides towards them.</p><p>ARTEMIS picks up her pace and overtakes ORION to meet her brother.</p><p>As she greets him, she strokes his face and he strokes hers.</p><p>Then she walks beyond APOLLO to the carcass of the previous dog and collects some meat for herself.</p><p>APOLLO greets ORION in the same way with which he had greeted his sister, by caressing ORION's face gently.</p><p>ORION swings the fresh kill from off his shoulders and presents it to APOLLO.</p><p>APOLLO collects the dog from ORION and ORION caresses his face.</p><p>APOLLO turns away from ORION and carries the dog toward the carcass of the last meal, and to ARTEMIS still standing by it.</p><p>From the edge of the fields, ZAGREUS has been watching the actions of his fellowmen.</p><p>He sees ORION moving towards him.</p><p>But then he turns back and looks out across the fields.</p><p>He longs for journey outside of their established territory.</p><p>ORION arrives alongside ZAGREUS and signifies his presence.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ORION</h4><p>Ogh!</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ZAGREUS</h4><p>Mh.</p></div> <p>ORION places one hand on ZAGREUS' shoulder, precariously held to meet with the flesh of his neck; rather than merely the fabric of his clothing.</p><p>ZAGREUS raises his arm and gestures out over the fields.</p><p>He looks to ORION.</p><p>ORION seems not to understand.</p><p>ZAGREUS raises both his arms and gestures, waving his arms outwards repeatedly.</p><p>ORION watches then looks into ZAGREUS' face.</p><p>He then looks back out across the fields and takes a step forward.</p><p>ZAGREUS clutches at ORION's arm and draws him back.</p><p>He steps in front of ORION and gestures.</p><p>First he thrusts his hands into ORION's chest, then at his own chest and then toward the farmhouse.</p><p>ORION turns toward the farmhouse.</p><p>He looks back to ZAGREUS and places one hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Then he raises his other hand and gently caresses ZAGREUS' face.</p><p>The two turn back to the farmhouse and walk to return to it.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT</h3><p>The group sit around the crackling embers of a fire beneath the cooking torso of a dog.</p><p>ZAGREUS and ORION are the centre of attention as they tell gestures of their want to go exploring.</p><p>ZAGREUS takes lead, gesturing to himself and then thrusting his arms away into the distance.</p><p>APOLLO appears concerned.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>APOLLO</h4><p>Agh!</p></div> <p>APOLLO raises his arm as ZAGREUS stops to look at him.</p><p>APOLLO then lowers his hand to the ground and pats it, gesturing his wish to stay.</p><p>ARTEMIS is sat beside him and views his motions understandingly, but with contemplation of her own.</p><p>It is ATHENA who first stands and approaches ZAGREUS.</p><p>She steps to him then raises her hand to his face and strokes it gently, finally resting her hand on his shoulder.</p><p>She turns back to the rest of the group but remains standing with ZAGREUS and ORION.</p><p>LACEDAEMON then stands, and HELLEN beside him watches.</p><p>LACEDAEMON approaches ZAGREUS and strokes his face.</p><p>HELLEN then stands too.</p><p>He is tentative for a moment then approaches ZAGREUS and does the same.</p><p>ZAGREUS strokes his face in reciprocation, now elating in the support.</p><p>ARTEMIS then stands, her brother APOLLO looking up to her with muzzled shock.</p><p>She extends her arm to him invitingly.</p><p>APOLLO lowers his hand to the ground and pats it once more, then looks up to ARTEMIS pleadingly.</p><p>ARTEMIS bows her head to the ground, then swallows her fear and turns to ZAGREUS.</p><p>She caresses ZAGREUS' face and then ORION's as she stands between them.</p><p>APOLLO jumps up into a squat and then moves away from the group, quicker for being on all-fours.</p><p>ARTEMIS watches, then follows; slower as she walks.</p><p>APOLLO rests himself against the farmhouse then sees ARTEMIS coming to join him.</p><p>She sits against the farmhouse beside him.</p><p>He gestures to the ground, patting it.</p><p>She shows no will to change her mind and thumps her bosom before gesturing outwards toward the fields.</p><p>APOLLO bows his head, defeated.</p><p>ARTEMIS puts a hand to his face and strokes it.</p><p>He raises his head and she smiles at him as he does so.</p><p>Then she rests her head against his shoulder.</p><p>He raises his arm to put it around her, and holds her in an embrace.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>ZAGREUS, ORION, ARTEMIS, ATHENA, HERMES, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS stand toward the expanse of open field behind themselves.</p><p>They are saying their goodbyes to the rest, APOLLO, MELINOE, HEPHAESTUS, THEBE, KEROESSA, AMPHION, ZETHUS and LOCRUS.</p><p>ARTEMIS strokes her brother, APOLLO's face, as he does the same in farewell to her.</p><p>As she turns away, his hand lingers against her cheek until she is out of his reach.</p><p>She walks to the rest of the leaving group.</p><p>ZAGREUS is caressing the face of MELINOE, who is fairly without reciprocation but smiles weakly.</p><p>He turns back to the leaving group and walks straight through them.</p><p>As ZAGREUS takes the lead, others turn and follow; first HERMES and ATHENA, then HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS.</p><p>ORION waits, looking toward ARTEMIS, then he too turns to follow ZAGREUS into the fields.</p><p>Finally, ARTEMIS bows her head from looking toward her brother.</p><p>She turns and walks briskly to catch up to ORION at the rear of the leaving group.</p><p>Those that stay behind begin to turn back to the farmhouse; MELINOE is first to turn, followed by KEROESSA, then the twins AMPHION and ZETHUS, HEPHAESTUS, THEBE then LOCRUS.</p><p>APOLLO is the last left standing still staring out at the group which leaves for exploration.</p><p>He too then bows his head and turns to walk back to the farmhouse.</p><h3>EXT. A FENCE, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>Led by ZAGREUS, ARTEMIS, HERMES, ORION, ATHENA, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS walk through the forest.</p><p>Their strides are clumsy and tentative and most use the dense array of trees to support themselves.</p><p>ATHENA follows ZAGREUS most closely, looking at the environment around them as though to assess it.</p><p>ORION strides almost alongside her with ARTEMIS following closely behind him.</p><p>As they head through the dense forest, the well-trodden path in front of them seems to lead to light ahead, a clearing.</p><p>ZAGREUS is cautious, lowering himself to the ground as they approach. Others follow suit; ARTEMIS and ORION knowing best how to stay low and keep quiet.</p><p>ATHENA stays upright but takes caution in keeping close to trees for cover.</p><p>The group encounter a fence which extends far into the distance either way, though on the well-trodden path there is a break in the fence which has clearly been made in a violent charge through it.</p><p>The fence appears to have been formerly electrified, with warning signs and generators lining it; it is now, however, dead.</p><p>The group pass through the break in the fence, observing it as they step over the broken links at the ground beneath them.</p><p>ATHENA lingers at the fence, observing its structure.</p><p>She reaches her hand to it and puts her fingers through the links.</p><p>She clutches at it, then strokes the fence, looking one way down it and then far down into the distance the other way.</p><p>She sees no breaks for the remainder of its visibility.</p><p>As the group passes by behind her, she rejoins it alongside the stragglers, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS.</p><h3>EXT. THE PASTURE - DAY</h3><p>ZAGREUS leads the group into a clearing, an open field that expands far towards another treeline.</p><p>HERMES, ARTEMIS, ORION, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS follow him, with ATHENA close to their rear examining the lay of the land.</p><p>She advances through the group toward the head of their pack.</p><p>As they continue through the field, ATHENA shows peaked interest in a group of strange animals grazing in the pasture; these are cows.</p><p>The cows graze quietly and at some distance from the group, mostly ignoring them.</p><p>Beyond the cows, a hill obscures further view of the field.</p><p>The group comes closer to the cows and ARTEMIS clutches at ORION's shoulder.</p><p>She gestures towards a calf, left somewhat astray from the rest of the group.</p><p>ORION bites his lip in contemplation of flavour.</p><p>He advances toward ZAGREUS and clutches at his shoulder.</p><p>ZAGREUS halts and the group halts with him.</p><p>ORION indicates to him, first by thumping his chest and then by gesturing out toward the calf, that he intends to make a kill.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks at ORION's gesture, then to the calf, then to the group.</p><p>He lowers himself to a crouch and the rest follow in kind.</p><p>ORION then takes the lead, ARTEMIS following close to him.</p><p>ZAGREUS and the others hold back, moving more slowly in the same direction.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS step slowly and tentatively towards the lonely calf.</p><p>As they get closer, it looks up to them from its grazing.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS freeze on the spot.</p><p>The calf stares at them a moment before bowing its head to graze once more.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS take a few slow steps forward.</p><p>ORION crouches to the ground, readying himself for a run.</p><p>ARTEMIS too lowers herself.</p><p>He makes the first dash, moving quickly toward the calf.</p><p>She is quick to follow.</p><p>The startled calf looks up and begins to try and bound away but ORION leaps at it and tackles it to the floor.</p><p>ARTEMIS quickly catches up to him where he has pinned the struggling calf down.</p><p>She clenches her fists tightly together into a single, connected ball.</p><p>She slams her clenched fists down against the calf's head.</p><p>It screeches distressed moos out for the other cows, who also begin to reciprocate in mooing.</p><p>A female cow begins bounding across the field towards ARTEMIS and ORION, and is soon joined from over the hill by a bull charging towards them.</p><p>As ARTEMIS slams her fists down against the calf once again, ORION looks at the dramatic charge of the cow and bull headed toward them.</p><p>As the cow approaches quickly, he throws himself into ARTEMIS sending her and himself across the ground finally to be pinned against it.</p><p>He presses himself back up, remaining over ARTEMIS as he spots the bull now paused and grunting at them to intimidate.</p><p>ORION hops up quickly and gives his hand to ARTEMIS to help her up.</p><p>The two cautiously, and panicked, back away from the bull.</p><p>It continues to grunt at them and stomps its hooves.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS make a run back to the rest of the group as the bull gives chase.</p><p>The group, seeing this, disperses.</p><p>HERMES darts straight for the treeline which had been ahead of them in their journey.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS turn and follow his path as the bull charges straight by them.</p><p>ATHENA and ZAGREUS too manage to run out of its way, as it charges for HELLEN.</p><p>HELLEN is knocked down by the charging bull, as LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS fall out of its way behind him.</p><p>ZAGREUS turns to see the action as ATHENA continues dashing away.</p><p>She soon stops at a safer distance to look back.</p><p>As the bull now circles, GRACEUS is running for the treeline.</p><p>LACEDAEMON remains, approaching the fallen HELLEN to help him back up.</p><p>The bull beats its hoof against the ground once more ready to charge the pair of them.</p><p>Supporting HELLEN, LACEDAEMON cannot get away as quickly as he might've.</p><p>ZAGREUS runs in to divert the bull.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ZAGREUS</h4><p>ARGH! RAARGH!</p></div> <p>He dashes across their path, leading the bulls charge away from its direct course with them.</p><p>As it comes close to striking him, he dives out of its way.</p><p>ZAGREUS continues a game of cat-and-mouse with the bull while LACEDAEMON helps HELLEN toward ATHENA.</p><p>ATHENA then helps LACEDAEMON to lead HELLEN more quickly toward the treeline.</p><p>When they are a safe enough distance toward it, ZAGREUS too runs in the direction of the trees to find cover.</p><h3>EXT. THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>ORION and ARTEMIS run through the forest together.</p><p>Behind him, she trips and falls into him.</p><p>The two topple to the ground, but ARTEMIS  is quick to roll around and look back out to the clearing far through the trees behind them.</p><p>She is crouched over ORION, who tilts his head to look out towards the clearing from where it seems danger is no longer approaching.</p><p>The two are breathless.</p><p>He looks up to ARTEMIS as she continues to look out through the trees.</p><p>ORION uplifts her and topples her to the ground, rolling onto her himself.</p><p>He puts his hand firmly against her neck and cheek and leans his face into her other side to bite her neck.</p><p>She yelps, and pushes him away.</p><p>ARTEMIS raises her hand to where ORION had bit her and strokes it to put pressure on the pain.</p><p>She looks up to ORION, who still remains perched over her.</p><p>Then she swings her leg behind his so as to weaken his stance and she rolls him back to the ground beneath her.</p><p>She is gentle as she puts her hand to his face in the familiar caress of greeting.</p><p>Then she leans into him and bites where his lower lip meets his cheek.</p><p>As she does so she begins to thrust her lower body against ORION's.</p><p>The two take one another into tighter embraces and rub against one another.</p><p>Her loosely fitting trousers begin to fall from her waist.</p><p>ORION then rolls her back to the floor and puts himself above her once more.</p><p>He thrusts his crotch against hers as the pair continue to caress, embrace and violently, passionately bite one another.</p><p>Their exhausted breathlessness becomes the breathlessness of ecstasy as they continue.</p><h3>INT. OBSERVATION HALLWAY - DAY</h3><p>COEUS, a man in his fifties, stands observing through the glass of the observation hallway high above the forest.</p><p>He is looking down towards the farm, where KEROESSA, THEBE, AMPHION, HEPHAESTUS and APOLLO are seen performing various tasks or sitting around a roasted animal, taking from and eating its flesh.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ASTERIA</h4><p>Dad?</p></div> <p>COEUS' daughter, a young teenage girl, ASTERIA is sat on the ground behind him.</p><p>She is sat with a collection of basic rations, a large camping rucksack and a pair of sleeping bags.</p><p>COEUS turns to his daughter.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Don't worry, sweetie. We'll set off home soon. Here...</p></div> <p>He gives ASTERIA his camera, futuristic, light and aesthetically efficient but recognisably a camera.</p><p>He crouches down with her and begins collecting items, dragging his rucksack towards him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Let's start packing.</p></div> <p>ASTERIA deposits the ultra-thin camera into a fabric sleeve and seals it.</p><p>Far below, MELINOE emerges from the farmhouse.</p><p>APOLLO walks to her and the two embrace with a hug and the familiar greeting of a facial caress.</p><h3>EXT. COMMUNAL PLAZA - DAY</h3><p>The communal plaza sits at the centre of a semicircle of tall, segmented buildings, each efficiently stacked and divided into rows and columns of equally spacious rooms and lobbies.</p><p>The plaza is beautiful, with vegetation and a great three-dimensional structure at its centre, which acts as a map of the world itself - incorporating the plaza, the residential district behind it and the forest which lays beyond a large steel, mechanically operated door directly ahead of the sculpture.</p><p>In the plaza, people gather and communicate with one another.</p><p>Many stand facing the large door as they converse, in wait of its opening.</p><p>To one side of the plaza, COEUS and ASTERIA emerge onto a walkway from beyond a door which appears to have been forced ajar and then held open with a make-shift wedge.</p><p>ASTERIA lets her father walk along the walkway ahead of her, as she removes the wedge from the door and allows it to shut.</p><p>She then follows COEUS towards a ladder.</p><p>He has waited for her and lets her descend first.</p><p>In the plaza below, some have noticed the return of COEUS and ASTERIA and have begun to turn and shift towards them.</p><p>COEUS and ASTERIA enter the plaza, COEUS greeting people as they pass them by.</p><p>ASTERIA stays close to her father, nervous of the crowds interest in them.</p><p>A man of similar age to COEUS moves quickly through the crowd towards him.</p><p>This man is CRONUS.</p><p>He allows COEUS to remove his rucksack and drop it to the ground before greeting him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Coe!</p></div> <p>He extends a hand to COEUS as he reaches only arm's length distance from him.</p><p>COEUS shakes his hand.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Cro.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>What have you found?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Trouble...

If I could have your attention.</p></div> <p>A hush falls across the ground, only whispers remaining.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>My daughter, Asteria, and I... We have spent two nights looking over the farms of the forest and we have seen trouble for us all. It is not the extended quarantine we had feared, though it is perhaps worse.</p></div> <p>Hushed whispers in the crowd elevate in volume slightly.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>The forest contains people, new people! Dwelling in the farmhouse; they forage food and hunt animals. I don't know their purpose, and I couldn't presume. But it seems our rightful place, and those jobs which many of us found our livelihood, have been taken from us and given to these new people! I can only think they must have been grown very rapidly; they behave strangely so I believe they've experienced a stunted development. But if they can prove efficient in our former roles, I fear for us. I fear our superiors are breeding our successors; a breed of slaves.</p></div> <p>Whispers in the crowd grow louder still as people begin to engage in discussion and COEUS steps down from the sculpture.</p><p>There is a large rush of people demanding to talk to him more.</p><p>It is THEMIS, a woman of his age, who first manages to grab his attention.</p><p>She leans into him to speak her mind intimately.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>You've caused a bit of an uproar.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>I have evidence; Cro has my camera.</p></div> <p>COEUS walks back towards ASTERIA and CRONUS with THEMIS alongside him.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>Coeus... you must admit that these presumptions are just that.</p></div> <p>COEUS arrives at CRONUS and ASTERIA.</p><p>He retrieves his camera from CRONUS and hands it to THEMIS.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>See for yourself.</p></div> <p>There is a sudden loud grinding as the large door to the forest begins to open.</p><p>The crowd hushes, ceasing to harass COEUS, as people look towards the door.</p><p>THEMIS continues to examine pictures on COEUS' camera.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE FOREST, COMMUNAL PLAZA - DAY</h3><p>The large door to the forest opens and two heavy trucks pull into the communal plaza.</p><p>Armed guards walk in with them, several staying at the door to protect the exit.</p><p>The door is almost completely shut again, to keep anyone from trying to get through.</p><p>The two trucks turn and stop in the plaza so that their rear doors are somewhat facing the gathered crowd of citizens.</p><p>Guards then open up the doors of the trucks and begin to unload supplies as the crowd draws closer to them.</p><p>There are shouts from the crowd, at the guards, and a commotion at the front as people collecting boxes attempt to question them.</p><p>EREBUS, the commanding guard, climbs up to the top of a truck.</p><p>He raises a microphone to his mouth and his voice is amplified through the trucks' speaker systems.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EREBUS</h4><p>People!

A ROAD, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>The convoy of two trucks and two jeeps drives down the main road through the forest.</p><p>They pass by trees along their way.</p><p>Deep in the trees, ATHENA hears the convoy and turns her attention to where the sound is coming from.</p><p>She turns back to ZAGREUS whose attention has been caught too.</p><p>LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS sit tending to the exhausted and injured HELLEN.</p><p>ZAGREUS quickly bursts into a run towards the sound of the convoy.</p><p>ATHENA follows after him and HERMES sets off after her.</p><p>ZAGREUS halts near to the road and ATHENA comes to a stop behind him.</p><p>HERMES keeps further back.</p><p>ZAGREUS and ATHENA watch as the convoy passes along the road, their vehicles containing many guards, along with EREBUS.</p><p>HERMES draws himself closer to the rear of ZAGREUS and ATHENA as he watches the convoy too.</p><p>Quickly the convoy has passed, and the group cautiously crawl out onto the road.</p><p>ZAGREUS looks down to where the convoy is heading.</p><p>ATHENA examines the road, dust still dancing through the air from the disruption of the trucks and jeeps.</p><p>HERMES remains in the trees, staring also down toward the fast disappearing convoy.</p><p>A little way up the road, ORION emerges from the trees with ARTEMIS close by him.</p><p>They too look towards the convoy, then turn to look back up the other way.</p><p>Their attention meets with the presence of ZAGREUS and ATHENA.</p><p>Then all look back to the convoy.</p><p>ZAGREUS is first to begin moving back into the trees.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS slowly make their way up the road together, to follow him.</p><p>ATHENA too follows, after HERMES who is close on ZAGREUS' tail.</p><h3>EXT. SECURITY FACILITY, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>The convoy of two trucks and two jeeps arrives back at base-camp; a large complex built over-ground, well defended as though a fort.</p><p>Two guards stand at the entrance, and open the gate to the trucks.</p><p>Inside the courtyard, the guards on board each truck and in the jeeps unload.</p><p>EREBUS strides out ahead of most to meet with their superior, CHAOS.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>You mentioned bad news.</p></div> <p>CHAOS turns with EREBUS to walk with him back to the entrance of the security complex.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EREBUS</h4><p>Yes sir. The civilians have found out about the human-beta project, sir. They have pictures, and their people are restless in want of answers.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>Hmm... We'll have to discuss something. Perhaps it's almost time I addressed them.</p></div> <p>CHAOS opens the door to the facility but holds it open for EREBUS.</p><p>EREBUS walks through and CHAOS follows him in.</p><h3>INT. SUBWAY STATION, COMMUNAL PLAZA - NIGHT</h3><p>A group of civilians break through the locks on a gate to the subway platform.</p><p>They draw the gates aside to allow a passage through.</p><p>CRONUS, COEUS and ASTERIA pass through the gap, followed by THEMIS.</p><p>Other civilians accompany them.</p><p>CRONUS addresses the group.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>We can use the subway to get to the forest's central station. From there, it's only a short journey to the farm; a few kilometres.</p></div> <p>The group are divided into those prepared for a journey, and those not.</p><p>COEUS and ASTERIA have a rucksack between them; she carries lighter goods in her hands.</p><p>CRONUS too is packed for the journey.</p><p>Other civilians are packing the equipment used to break the gate back into another rucksack.</p><p>They join CRONUS, COEUS and ASTERIA.</p><p>THEMIS stands at the other side of them, to stay behind.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>You all have double rations for the next two weeks; try to make them last. When you meet with the new people, try to stay with them; observe what they do, communicate with them. An alliance would be preferable to their extermination.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Extermination? This is a reconnaissance mission.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>It's early. I don't want you to act in any way that might harm them, but we have to consider them a threat to us... to our privilege to remain civilians of Mnemosyne.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>We're expensive, they're not. We have needs as civilians and as consumers, we have wants. If they're to be bred as slaves, they will have little of either.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>That's right. Do what you must. Observe them before you try to meet them; if they are hostile, cease engagement, return and we'll consider our options.</p></div> <p>COEUS appears concerned.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Coeus, you have a problem?</p></div> <p>He looks to THEMIS.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>No, ma'am.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>All right. Not for want to sound military but... move out!</p></div> <p>COEUS nods, he and some of the others including ASTERIA at his side begin to move onto the tracks and into the subway tunnel.</p><p>Others embrace persons of the other group before doing the same.</p><p>CRONUS stays to speak intimately to THEMIS.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Well then... See you in a fortnight or two.</p></div> <p>He hugs her, to her reciprocation.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>THEMIS</h4><p>Stay as long as you can.</p></div> <p>Their embrace stops and he smiles at her before setting out to walk with the rest of the group into the tunnel.</p><h3>EXT. A ROAD, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>ZAGREUS, HELLEN, LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS walk down the centre of the road.</p><p>ZAGREUS leads, with LACEDAEMON behind.</p><p>HELLEN appears to limp but has healed well and appears to walk with only minor discomfort.</p><p>GRACEUS follows him from the rear of the group.</p><p>ATHENA and HERMES walk to the edge of the road, carrying foraged fruits and vegetation.</p><p>ATHENA leads, examining the trees about them carefully for more food.</p><h3>EXT. THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>ARTEMIS searches the ground for tracks, moving quickly along the forest floor in the process of hunting.</p><p>ORION is not too far behind her, searching through the trees around them for sign of a meal.</p><p>There appears to be none coming.</p><p>Still ARTEMIS searches, hunting.</p><p>ORION halts, dismayed at the lack of prey.</p><p>ARTEMIS continues to scour the floor.</p><p>She halts, leaning into herself with discomfort on her face.</p><p>She clutches at her stomach.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ARTEMIS</h4><p>Uugh!</p></div> <p>ORION moves quickly to her.</p><p>He puts his hand on her back and looks toward her face.</p><p>She looks up to him.</p><p>In a moment, she turns away, recovers and returns to scouring the forest floor.</p><p>ORION, confused and concerned, freezes for a second or two before continuing to follow her.</p><h3>INT. SURVEILLANCE ROOM, SECURITY FACILITY - DAY</h3><p>The room is dark, its light mainly coming from the glow of many monitors which show different regions of Mnemosyne's outer environments.</p><p>HEMERA is the lone security technician and psychologist in charge of monitoring the beta-subjects.</p><p>The screens directly in front of her show the farmhouse, its interiors and exteriors, the road where ZAGREUS and others are still walking, and of particular focus the forest nearby where ARTEMIS and ORION continue to hunt.</p><p>HEMERA types a note into her tablet computer.</p><p>There is a knock at the door.</p><p>HEMERA turns to see her superior, another psychologist, enter.</p><p>ANANKE walks to HEMERA and stands over the monitors next to her.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ANANKE</h4><p>Any news?</p></div> <p>HEMERA smiles at ANANKE.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HEMERA</h4><p>Big news!

She and uhmm...</p></div> <p>HEMERA checks her notes.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HEMERA (CONT'D)</h4><p>She and Orion only copulated a week ago, but the signs are showing.</p></div> <p>ANANKE looks to HEMERA.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ANANKE</h4><p>A week?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HEMERA</h4><p>Uhm...</p></div> <p>HEMERA checks her notes again.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>HEMERA (CONT'D)</h4><p>Nine days. But I've noted subtle signs for the past twelve hours.</p></div> <p>ANANKE smiles.</p><p>She sits down next to HEMERA.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>ANANKE</h4><p>Take me through your notes.</p></div> <h3>EXT. CENTRAL STATION, THE FOREST - DUSK</h3><p>CRONUS and his group exit the subway station.</p><p>COEUS and ASTERIA are close behind him.</p><p>CRONUS examines the area and looks up to the sky.</p><p>He turns to the rest of the group.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>We should head back into the station to make camp. Last thing we want is to be seen out here before morning. The road is nearby, but we'll avoid it; there's only one crossing that will be necessary on our way to the farm tomorrow.</p></div> <p>He looks up towards the sky.</p><p>The light-streak which stretches out across the centre of the sky is fading and the blue either side of it gradually darkening.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>It's almost night... Coe?</p></div> <p>COEUS takes his cue and addresses the rest of the group.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>There could still be wild dogs in the forest. Our old shepherding dogs have turned feral without us.</p></div> <p>CRONUS bows his head.</p><p>Then he looks back up, swallowing his regret.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>That's why we should travel by daylight. It will keep us safe; let us be alert... Head inside and set up.</p></div> <p>The group shuffles and collects their items, moving back into the subway.</p><p>CRONUS turns and looks out through the trees.</p><p>COEUS walks to him.</p><p>ASTERIA stands waiting for her father to walk back.</p><p>COEUS puts his hand on CRONUS' shoulder.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>Come on.</p></div> <p>CRONUS turns to COEUS and the pair walk back to ASTERIA.</p><p>She joins them and they all walk back into the subway.</p><h3>EXT. A DOOR, THE FOREST - DUSK</h3><p>ZAGREUS, HERMES and ATHENA exit the forest's dense trees ahead of GRACEUS, LACEDAEMON and HELLEN.</p><p>They meet with an opening which reconnects to the main road extending far through the forest behind them.</p><p>ZAGREUS halts and marvels at the object in front of him, casting his sights far up it.</p><p>ATHENA too marvels but continues moving.</p><p>She turns to excitement and makes a run towards it.</p><p>HERMES crouches to the ground and looks up at the marvel in front of them.</p><p>ORION and ARTEMIS, him trying to care to her for she appears exhausted, emerge last from the trees.</p><p>But ORION is then distracted from attempting to tend to ARTEMIS as he too is struck with awe by the massive object in front of them.</p><p>He halts as ARTEMIS carries on, looking up at the great object as she comes to rest at the floor next to HERMES.</p><p>The object that has them marvelling is a gigantic door, shining in the dimming light of dusk.</p><p>ATHENA has ran straight up to the door and is rubbing it.</p><p>She is able to see her reflection in the frosted metal of the door as she rubs her hand across it.</p><p>The speed with which darkness falls grows faster and ATHENA looks up toward the sky.</p><p>Up above, the streak of light which extends across the sky is here seen to have an end point from which it only extends continuously back down the main road.</p><p>ZAGREUS lowers himself to the ground.</p><p>ATHENA at the door does so too and crawls back toward the rest of the group.</p><p>They all turn and head back into the trees, disappearing in the darkness of the forest.</p><h3>EXT. A ROAD, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>Two jeeps and a truck drive quickly down the dirt road.</p><p>The jeeps sit ahead of and behind the truck and are loaded with armed guards.</p><p>In the trees, CRONUS and COEUS lay as low as they can to remain hidden.</p><p>They watch and remain silent as the convoy passes by.</p><p>With the jeeps and the truck moving quickly out of sight, COEUS and CRONUS rise to a crouch.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>They're not due again, are they?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Not for a month or so.</p></div> <p>COEUS leans out to see the convoy far in the distance.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>COEUS</h4><p>This is bad.</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS</h4><p>Definitely...</p></div> <p>CRONUS stands.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CRONUS (CONT'D)</h4><p>We should keep moving.</p></div> <p>He turns backwards and looks through the trees behind him.</p><p>He whistles.</p><p>The rest of the group emerge cautiously from far behind.</p><p>ASTERIA is with them and walks most quickly to catch up to her father.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE COMMUNAL PLAZA, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>The front jeep of the convoy, consisting of itself, a truck and another jeep, arrives at the door.</p><p>It stops and the convoy halts behind it.</p><p>Three soldiers exit the jeep.</p><p>One walks to a console next to the door as the others stand in front of the door, guns raised.</p><p>The door slides open and the two soldiers walk through.</p><p>There is no gathering at the other side as they are not expected.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE FOREST, COMMUNAL PLAZA - DAY</h3><p>The convoy proceeds into the plaza, the first jeep followed by the truck and then the other jeep.</p><p>Two armed guards stand ahead of it, ready to defend.</p><p>In the plaza, people start to collect.</p><p>Others are rushing to bring more people and a gathering begins to build.</p><p>The jeeps and the truck come to a rest, having turned so that they can be ready to drive back out at any time.</p><p>Guards file out of the vehicles and form a defensive line between them and the gathering crowd ahead.</p><p>EREBUS is last to exit from the rear of the truck, after his men.</p><p>CHAOS exits the jeep which had been at the rear of the convoy.</p><p>The two men approach each other and briefly chat.</p><p>EREBUS leads CHAOS back to the truck, then lets him climb the ladder first.</p><p>EREBUS follows CHAOS up the ladder to the truck's roof.</p><p>He hands CHAOS the microphone.</p><p>CHAOS stands, waiting, and looks out over the crowd gathering ahead of them.</p><p>The crowd are cautious and remain stood some way back from the line of armed guards between them and the convoy.</p><p>CHAOS raises the microphone to his mouth.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>People of Mnemosyne!</p></div> <p>THEMIS pushes her way through to the front of the crowd.</p><p>People are quick to move out of her way, acknowledging her official status.</p><p>She stands and looks directly up to CHAOS.</p><p>He looks directly at her before glancing across the rest of the crowd.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>For some time now we have held the forest off limits to you; many of you were told this was a part of the quarantine phase following our tragic pandemic. We, all of us lost our friends, our colleagues and our loved ones to that horrid illness. But we fought it, as best we could we fought it and it... and we could not defeat it. So it is true that the forest was held under quarantine for some time. But our populous lost innumerable lives before we could effectively defend ourselves against it. Testing since has revealed that those of us who remain are naturally immune to the contagion. This does not change the fact however, that we have restricted your access to the forest for the past six years in order to protect you! Your lives are invaluable, and your roles in the task ahead are irreplaceable.</p></div> <p>He pauses, looking over the crowd as some begin to whisper quietly to others.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>But it is true that we have experimented with breeding new humans.</p></div> <p>Whispers grow to murmurs and the crowd begins to shuffle restlessly.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Please, settle down!</p></div> <p>The crowd quietens slightly.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>These humans are part of an experiment, they are a beta run of a concept proposed by our psychologist and genetic technician, Ananke Greco... As I have said, a great number of our populous was tragically lost. It is Ms. Greco's hypothesis that these beta-humans will be necessary for our survival as a species in the times ahead. They are of our own blood, kin to many of you who donated genetic samples; these are people just like us. And we believe that they are our only option to populate, to nurture a new ecosystem, and to develop our new world when we make dock. We would appreciate your co-operation in these, our times of great need.</p></div> <p>The crowd is hushed as CHAOS pauses to look over them.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS (CONT'D)</h4><p>Are there any questions?</p></div> <p>A MAN yells out from the crowd.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>MAN</h4><p>Why weren't we told sooner?</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>The experiment has been on a need to know basis for the past five years; our team on the project has monitored their growth through incubation and into...</p></div> <div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>MAN</h4><p>That's horseshit! This is exactly the sort of thing we need to know!</p></div> <p>The crowd grows restless, loud, as murmurs grow into heavy discussion.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>CHAOS</h4><p>People, please!</p></div> <p>The crowd does not listen and a charge begins from the front, forward toward the guards.</p><p>It is a few men who advance, running toward the guards who raise their guns.</p><p>A few large cracking bangs and jets of light are emitted as the guards send their electric ammunition into the bodies of the runners.</p><p>This only agitates the rest of the crowd more, and doesn't keep those electrocuted from clumsily stumbling to their feet and aimlessly trying to continue their advance.</p><p>The guards all take to combat stances as a surge of people pushes forward.</p><div class=\"dialogue\"><h4>EREBUS</h4><p class=\"parenthetical\">(to CHAOS)</p><p>I would advise we leave here immediately, sir.</p></div> <p>CHAOS nods in agreement then heads for the ladder.</p><p>He climbs down it swiftly as EREBUS follows him.</p><p>EREBUS and CHAOS jog quickly across to a jeep and enter it.</p><p>A small collection of guards also file into the jeep.</p><p>It starts up and heads quickly through the door, waiting at the other side.</p><p>Guards attempt to fight back the crowd physically.</p><p>Only when some get through do they fire their electric weapons.</p><p>Those that are taken down by the weapons are now left motionless on the floor, their settings having been increased.</p><p>This is enough to encourage most people to stay back.</p><p>The guards forming the defensive line are able to draw back and load into the truck, as those guards already through the door use their own electric rifles to fend off the crowd.</p><p>With the truck quickly loaded, it sets off through the doorway.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE COMMUNAL PLAZA, THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS</h3><p>Some of the crowd manage to get through but are shot down immediately.</p><p>Their bodies are quickly lifted, dragged and then thrown back through the doorway as it closes.</p><p>With the door sealed, the last of the guards return to their jeep and get in.</p><p>The convoy proceeds to drive off down the road.</p><h3>EXT. A DOOR, THE FOREST - DAY</h3><p>ATHENA is examining a locking mechanism to one side of and away from the door.</p><p>She strokes it curiously before taking her hand away.</p><p>She reaches around her neck and removes a string necklace with the old green key card attached to it.</p><p>She turns the key card over and attempts to press it against the locking mechanism, but it is clear this needs a traditional key to be opened.</p><p>She turns the key card over and over, pressing it on the mechanism in different ways and failing to have it do anything.</p><p>She looks across to an identical mechanism at the other side of the door, which ZAGREUS and APOLLO are examining.</p><p>She assumes all fours, so that she can move more quickly, and rushes across to them.</p><p>ZAGREUS is quick to step aside as ATHENA raises to standing upright once more.</p><p>She presses the key card against the mechanism and nothing happens.</p><p>She tries to flip the card again and press it on the mechanism in different ways.</p><p>Still nothing happens.</p><p>She looks to ZAGREUS and he looks back at her.</p><p>ZAGREUS takes the key card from her and attempts the same thing himself.</p><p>It achieves nothing.</p><p>APOLLO has ceased to examine the mechanism and is looking to the rest of their group sat toward the trees.</p><p>He looks to the exhausted and sickly looking ARTEMIS.</p><p>HERMES sits next to ARTEMIS and looks towards LACEDAEMON and GRACEUS who chase one another.</p><p>HELLEN too sits and watches GRACEUS and LACEDAEMON.</p><p>The pair are fighting one another for a scrap of food for the entertainment of HELLEN, who still holds his injured abdomen as he finds pain in laughter.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - DAY</h3><p>APOLLO and MELINOE sit together, enjoying one another's company.</p><p>He gestures, while holding a cob of corn, by thumping his chest then extending his arms rapidly toward the ground.</p><p>This causes MELINOE to laugh.</p><p>APOLLO tears off some kernels of corn with his teeth then offers the cob to MELINOE.</p><p>She takes it and has a bite herself.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS, KEROESSA, AMPHION, ZETHUS, THEBE and LOCRUS also move about the area performing various tasks or socialising.</p><h3>EXT.

THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT</h3><p>KEREOESSA carefully lifts a baby from beneath ARTEMIS.</p><p>She holds it for a moment as ARTEMIS smiles at it.</p><p>THEBE, ZETHUS and AMPHION stand aside, admiring as KEROESSA hands the baby to ARTEMIS.</p><p>Objects begin to rattle against the farmhouse.</p><h3>EXT. THE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT</h3><p>Leaves and branches are swept against the farmhouse.</p><p>Objects from the city also fly through the open area; wrappers and papers.</p><h3>EXT. DOOR TO THE FOREST, COMMUNAL PLAZA - NIGHT</h3><p>As objects fly all around them, a crowd gathers at the door.</p><p>THEMIS stands at the front of them, her own hair blowing wildly as a great wind collects everything and delivers it far down the road ahead.</p><h3>INT. LOBBY, SECURITY FACILITY - NIGHT</h3><p>APOLLO, MELINOE, LACEDAEMON, GRACEUS, CRONUS and ANANKE remain gathered around COEUS as he holds the deceased ASTERIA in his arms.</p><p>MELINOE still holds onto the girls arm and shoulder, with APOLLO resting a hand on her shoulder and caressing the neck of COEUS in respect and comfort as well.</p><p>A wind whips up through the room as CRONUS uncuffs ANANKE.</p><p>She returns her hands to COEUS, clutching his shoulder and rubbing his back.</p><p>As the wind picks up, it gathers attention.</p><p>CRONUS remains standing and watches out of the door, as light objects breeze past him through the room.</p><p>APOLLO raises his attentions, and ANANKE too looks about herself.</p><p>MELINOE is unphased, moving a hand to COEUS' arm and remaining focused on he and ASTERIA.</p><p>COEUS holds ASTERIA more tightly, burying his face as the strengthening wind pulls his tears horizontally across his cheek.</p><h3>EXT. A DOOR, THE FOREST - NIGHT</h3><p>The door opens, finally revealing a gap, as objects fly into it and out through the underneath.</p><p>ZAGREUS, ATHENA, HEPHAESTUS, ORION, HERMES, HELLEN and LOCRUS all stand back in awe of the event as the wind howls through the opening.</p><p>Soon, they too are being pulled towards the door, beginning to topple from their feet as the opening grows wider.</p><p>None can remain on their feet, but try to move back.</p><p>They all attempt to steady themselves and to back-up on all-fours but it is to no avail.</p><h3>EXT. MNEMOSYNE - SPACE</h3><p>From the outside of MNEMOSYNE, we see the betas swept through an opening doorway of the ship and into space.</p><p>The ship is incredibly vast, encompassing a large forest within a gigantic dome encompassing a small city at its middle which extends upwards and onto a tether, reaching far into space - to the ships pivotal point and counterweight far beyond that.</p><p>A giant text on her great dome reads âMNEMOSYNEâ.</p><p>As it turns, a phrase is revealed above her bay door which extends around the rim of the ship.</p><p>It reads, âThat they may not be forgotten.â</p><p>Still being flung from that door, are the betas, the civilians, the security, trees and all manner of debris from within.</p><p>The are lit by the lights from within, but those too
